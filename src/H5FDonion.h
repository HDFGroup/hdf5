 * Structure    H5FD_onion_fapl_info_t
 *
 * Purpose:     Encapsulate info for the Onion driver FAPL entry.
 *
 * version:     Future-proofing identifier. Informs struct membership.
 *              Must equal H5FD_ONION_FAPL_VERSION_CURR to be considered valid.
 *
 * backing_fapl_id:
 *              Backing or 'child' FAPL ID to handle I/O with the
 *              underlying backing store. If the onion data is stored as a
 *              separate file, it must use the same backing driver as the
 *              original file.
 *
 * page_size:   Size of the amended data pages. If opening an existing file,
 *              must equal the existing page size or zero. If creating a new
 *              file or an initial revision of an existing file, must be a
 *              power of 2.
 *
 * store_target:
 *              Enumerated/defined value identifying where the history data is
 *              stored, either in the same file (appended to HDF5 data) or a
 *              separate file. Other options may be added in later versions.
 *
 *              + H5FD_ONION_FAPL_STORE_MODE_SEPARATE_SINGLE (1)
 *                      Onion history is stored in a single, separate "onion
 *                      file". Shares filename and path as hdf5 file (if any),
 *                      with only a different filename extension.
 *
 * revision_id: Which revision to open. Must be 0 (the original file) or the
 *              revision number of an existing revision.
 *              Revision ID -1 is reserved to open the most recently-created
 *              revision in history.
 *
 * force_write_open:
 *              Flag to ignore the write-lock flag in the onion data
 *              and attempt to open the file write-only anyway.
 *              This may be relevant if, for example, the library crashed
 *              while the file was open in write mode and the write-lock
 *              flag was not cleared.
 *              Must equal H5FD_ONION_FAPL_FLAG_FORCE_OPEN to enable.
 *
 * creation_flags:
 *              Flag used only when instantiating an Onion file.
 *              If the relevant bit is set to a nonzero value, its feature
 *              will be enabled.
 *
 *              + H5FD_ONION_FAPL_CREATE_FLAG_ENABLE_DIVERGENT_HISTORY
 *                (1, bit 1)
 *                      User will be allowed to open arbitrary revisions
 *                      in write mode.
 *                      If disabled (0), only the most recent revision may be
 *                      opened for amendment.
 *
 *              + H5FD_ONION_FAPL_CREATE_FLAG_ENABLE_PAGE_ALIGNMENT (2, bit 2)
 *                      Onion history metadata will align to page_size.
 *                      Partial pages of unused space will occur in the file,
 *                      but may improve read performance from the backing store
 *                      on some systems.
 *                      If disabled (0), padding will not be inserted to align
 *                      to page boundaries.
 *
 *              + <Remaining bits reserved>
 *
 * comment:     User-supplied NULL-terminated comment for a revision to be
 *              written.
 *              Cannot be longer than H5FD_ONION_FAPL_COMMENT_MAX_LEN.
 *              Ignored if part of a FAPL used to open in read mode.
 *
 *              The comment for a revision may be modified prior to committing
 *              to the revision (closing the file and writing the record)
 *              with a call to H5FDfctl().
 *              This H5FDfctl overwrite may be used to exceed constraints of
 *              maximum string length and the NULL-terminator requirement.

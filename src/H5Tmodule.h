 * \details These are the datatypes detected during library \Emph{compilation}
 *          by \c H5detect(). Their names differ from other HDF5 datatype names
 *          as follows:
 *          \li Instead of a class name, precision and byte order as the last
 *              component, they have a C-like type name.
 *          \li If the type begins with \c U then it is the unsigned version of
 *              the integer type; other integer types are signed.
 *          \li The datatype \c LLONG corresponds C's \Code{long long} and
 *              \c LDOUBLE is \Code{long double}. These types might be the same
 *              as \c LONG and \c DOUBLE, respectively.

/*
 *  struct eot_queue_entry_t
 *
 *  This is the structure for an entry on the end-of-tick queue (EOT queue) of files
 *  opened in either VFD SWMR write or VFD SWMR read mode.  This queue is maintained
 *  in increasing end of tick time order.
 *  The structure contains all information required to determine whether the end
 *  of tick has arrived for the specified file, and to initiate end of tick processing
 *  if it has.
 *
 *  The fields of eot_queue_entry_t are discussed below:
 *
 *  vfd_swmr_file: Pointer to the instance of H5F_file_t containing the shared
 *      fields of the associated file that has been opened in VFD SWMR mode
 *  NOTE: for the time being use H5F_t instead of H5F_file_t
 *
 *  vfd_swmr_writer:  Boolean flag that is set to TRUE if the associated file
 *      has been opened in VFD SWMR writer mode, and FALSE if it has been
 *      opened in VFD SWMR reader mode.
 *
 *  tick_num: Number of the current tick of the target file.
 *
 *  end_of_tick: Expiration time of the current tick of the target file.
 *
 *  link: Forward and backward linkage between the next element and the previous
 *  element (or the queue head).  Note that if there is a following entry,
 *  `next`, then `next->end_of_tick` must be greater than or equal to
 *  `end_of_tick`.

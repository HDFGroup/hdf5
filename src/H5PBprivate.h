/******************************************************************************
 *
 * structure H5PB_t
 *
 * Catchall structure for all variables specific to an instance of the page
 * buffer.
 *
 * At present, the page buffer serves two purposes in the HDF5 library.
 *
 * Under normal operating conditions, it serves as a normal page buffer whose
 * purpose is to minimize and optimize file I/O by aggregating small metadata
 * and raw data writes into pages, and by caching frequently used pages.
 *
 * In addition, when a file is opened for VFD SWMR writing, the page buffer is
 * used to retain copies of all metadata pages and multi-page metadata entries
 * that are written in a given tick, and under certain cases, to delay metadata
 * page and/or multi-page metadata entry writes for some number of ticks.
 * If the entry has not appeared in the VFD SWMR index for at least max_lag
 * ticks, this is necessary to avoid message from the future bugs.  See the
 * VFD SWMR RFC for further details.
 *
 * To reflect this, the fields of this structure are divided into three
 * sections.  Specifically fields needed for general operations, fields needed
 * for VFD SWMR, and statistics.
 *
 * FIELDS FOR GENERAL OPERATIONS:
 *
 * magic:       Unsigned 32 bit integer that must always be set to
 *              H5PB__H5PB_T_MAGIC.  This field is used to validate pointers to
 *              instances of H5PB_t.
 *
 * page_size:   size_t containing the page buffer page size in bytes.
 *
 * max_pages:   64 bit integer containing the nominal maximum number
 *              of pages in the page buffer.  Note that on creation, the page
 *              buffer is empty, and that under certain circumstances (mostly
 *              related to VFD SWMR) this limit can be exceeded by large
 *              amounts.
 *
 * curr_pages:  64 bit integer containing the current number of pages
 *              in the page buffer.  curr_pages must always equal the sum of
 *              curr_md_pages + curr_rd_pages.
 *
 *              Note that in the context of VFD SWMR, this count does NOT
 *              include multi-page metadata entries.
 *
 * curr_md_pages: 64 bit integer containing the current number of
 *              metadata pages in the page buffer.
 *
 *              Note that in the context of VFD SWMR, this count does NOT
 *              include multi-page metadata entries.
 *
 * curr_rd_pages: 64 bit integer containing the current number of
 *              raw data pages in the page buffer.
 *
 * min_md_pages: 64 bit integer containing the number of pages in the
 *              page buffer reserved for metadata.  No metadata page may be
 *              evicted from the page buffer if curr_md_pages is less than or
 *              equal to this value.
 *
 * min_rd_pages: 64 bin integer containing the number of pages in the
 *              page buffer reserved for raw data.  No page or raw data may be
 *              evicted from the page buffer if curr_rd_pages is less than or
 *              equal to this value.
 *
 * The FAPL fields are used to store the page buffer configuration data
 * provided to the page buffer in the H5PB_create() call.
 *
 * max_size:    Maximum page buffer size supplied by the FAPL.
 *
 * min_meta_perc: Percent of the page buffer reserved for metadata as
 *              supplied in the FAPL.
 *
 * min_raw_perc: Percent of the page buffer reserved for metadata as
 *              supplied in the FAPL.
 *
 * The purpose of the index is to allow us to efficiently look up all pages
 * (and multi-page metadata entries in the context of VFD SWMR) in the
 * page buffer.
 *
 * This function is provided by a hash table with chaining, albeit with one
 * un-unusual feature.
 *
 * Specifically hash table size must be a power of two, and the hash function
 * simply clips the high order bits off the page offset of the entry.
 *
 * This should work, as space is typically allocated sequentually, and thus
 * via a reverse principle of locality argument, hot pages are unlikely to
 * hash to the same bucket.  That said, we must collect statistics to alert
 * us should this not be the case.
 *
 * We also maintain a linked list of all entries in the index to facilitate
 * flush operations.
 *
 * index        Array of pointer to H5PB_entry_t of size
 *              H5PB__HASH_TABLE_LEN.  This size must ba a power of 2,
 *              not the usual prime number.
 *
 * index_len:   Number of entries currently in the hash table used to index
 *              the page buffer.  index_len should always equal
 *              clean_index_len + dirty_index_len.
 *
 * clean_index_len: Number of clean entries currently in the hash table
 *              used to index the page buffer.
 *
 * dirty_index_len: Number of dirty entries currently in the hash table
 *              used to index the page buffer.
 *
 * index_size:  Number of bytes currently stored in the hash table used to
 *              index the page buffer.  Under normal circumstances, this
 *              value will be index_len * page size.  However, if
 *              vfd_swmr_writer is TRUE, it may be larger.
 *
 *              index_size should always equal clean_index_size +
 *              dirty_index_size.
 *
 * clean_index_size: Number of bytes of clean entries currently stored in
 *              the hash table used to index the page buffer.
 *
 * dirty_index_size: Number of bytes of dirty entries currently stored in
 *              the hash table used to index the page buffer.
 *
 * il_len:      Number of entries on the index list.
 *
 *              This must always be equal to index_len.  As such, this
 *              field is redundant.  However, the existing linked list
 *              management macros expect to maintain a length field, so
 *              this field exists primarily to avoid adding complexity to
 *              these macros.
 *
 * il_size:     Number of bytes of cache entries currently stored in the
 *              index list.
 *
 *              This must always be equal to index_size.  As such, this
 *              field is redundant.  However, the existing linked list
 *              management macros expect to maintain a size field, so
 *              this field exists primarily to avoid adding complexity to
 *              these macros.
 *
 * il_head:     Pointer to the head of the doubly linked list of entries in
 *              the index list.  Note that cache entries on this list are
 *              linked by their il_next and il_prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the index is empty.
 *
 * il_tail:     Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked list of entries in
 *              the index list.  Note that cache entries on this list are
 *              linked by their il_next and il_prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the index is empty.
 *
 *
 * Fields supporting the modified LRU policy:
 *
 * See most any OS text for a discussion of the LRU replacement policy.
 *
 * Under normal operating circumstances (i.e. vfd_swmr_writer is FALSE)
 * all entries will reside both in the index and in the LRU.  Further,
 * all entries will be of size page_size.
 *
 * The VFD SWMR writer case (i.e. vfd_swmr_writer is TRUE) is complicated
 * by the requirements that we:
 *
 * 1) buffer all metadat writes (including multi-page metadata writes) that
 *    occur during a tick, and
 *
 * 2) when necessary, delay metadata writes for up to max_lag ticks to
 *    avoid message from the future bugs on the VFD SWMR readers.
 *
 * See discussion of fields supporting VFD SWMR below for details.
 *
 * Discussions of the individual fields used by the modified LRU replacement
 * policy follow:
 *
 * LRU_len:     Number of page buffer entries currently on the LRU.
 *
 *              Observe that LRU_len + dwl_len must always equal
 *              index_len.
 *
 * LRU_size:    Number of bytes of page buffer entries currently residing
 *              on the LRU list.
 *
 *              Observe that LRU_size + dwl_size must always equal
 *              index_size.
 *
 * LRU_head_ptr:  Pointer to the head of the doubly linked LRU list.  Page
 *              buffer entries on this list are linked by their next and
 *              prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * LRU_tail_ptr:  Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked LRU list.  Page
 *              buffer entries on this list are linked by their next and
 *              prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 *
 * FIELDS SUPPORTING VFD SWMR:
 *
 * If the file is opened in VFD SWMR mode (i.e. vfd_swmr == TRUE), all
 * raw data I/O must be passed through to the HDF5 file
 *
 * If the file is opened as a VFD SWMR writer (i.e. vfd_swmr_writer == TRUE),
 * the page buffer must retain the data necessary to update the metadata
 * file at the end of each tick, and also delay writes as necessary so as
 * to avoid message from the future bugs on the VFD SWMR readers.
 *
 * The tick list exists to allow us to buffer copies of all metadata writes
 * during a tick, and the delayed write list supports delayed writes.
 *
 * If a regular page is written to during a tick, it is placed on the tick
 * list.  If there is no reason to delay its write to file (i.e. either
 * it was just allocated, or it has existed in the metadata file index for
 * at least max_lag ticks), it is also placed on the LRU, where it may be
 * flushed, but not evicted.  If its write must be delayed, it is placed on
 * the delayed write list, where it must remain until its write delay is
 * satisfied -- at which point it is moved to the LRU.
 *
 * If a multi-page metadata entry is written during a tick, it is placed on
 * the tick list.  If, in addition, the write of the entry must be delayed,
 * it is also place on the delayed write list.  Note that multi-page metadata
 * entries may never appear on the LRU.
 *
 * At the end of each tick, the tick list is emptied.
 *
 * Regular pages are simply removed from the tick list, as they must already
 * appear on either the LRU or the delayed write list.
 *
 * Multi-page metadata entries that are not also on the delayed write list
 * are simply flushed and evicted.
 *
 * The delayed write list is also scanned at the end of each tick.  Regular
 * entries that are now flushable are placed at the head of the LRU.  Multi-
 * page metadata entries that are flushable are flushed and evicted.
 *
 * The remainder of this sections contains discussions of the fields and
 * data structures used to support the above operations.
 *
 * vfd_swmr:    Boolean flag that is set to TRUE IFF the file is opened
 *              in VFD SWMR mode -- either reader or writer.  This field
 *              is used to exclude raw data from the page buffer.
 *
 * vfd_swmr_writer: Boolean flag that is set to TRUE iff the file is
 *              is opened in VFD SWMR writer mode.  The remaining
 *              VFD SWMR fields are defined iff vfd_swmr_writer is TRUE.
 *
 * mpmde_count: int64_t containing the number of multi-page metadata
 *              entries currently resident in the page buffer.  Observe
 *              that index_len should always equal curr_pages + mpmde_count.
 *
 * cur_tick:    uint64_t containing the current tick.  This is a copy of
 *              the same field in the associated instance of H5F_file_t,
 *              and is maintained as a convenience.
 *
 * In the context of VFD SWMR the delayed write list allows us to delay
 * metadata writes to the HDF5 file until it appears in all indexes in the
 * last max_lag ticks.  This is essential if a version of the page or
 * multi-page metadata entry already exists in the HDF5 file -- failure to
 * delay the write can result in a message from the future which will
 * likely be perciived as file corruption by the reader.
 *
 * To facilitate identification of entries that must be removed from the
 * DWL during the end of tick scan, the list always observes the following
 * invariant for any entry on the list:
 *
 *    entry_ptr->next == NULL ||
 *    entry_ptr->delay_write_until >= entry_ptr->next->delay_write_until
 *
 * Discussion of the fields used to implement the delayed write list follows:
 *
 * max_delay:   Maximum of the delay_write_until fields of the entries on
 *              the delayed write list.  This must never be more than max_lag
 *              ticks in advance of the current tick, and should be set to
 *              zero if the delayed write list is empty.
 *
 * dwl_len:     Number of page buffer entries currently on the delayed
 *              write list.
 *
 *              Observe that LRU_len + dwl_len must always equal
 *              index_len.
 *
 * dwl_size:    Number of bytes of page buffer entries currently residing
 *              on the LRU list.
 *
 *              Observe that LRU_size + dwl_size must always equal
 *              index_size.
 *
 * dwl_head_ptr:  Pointer to the head of the doubly linked delayed write list.
 *              Page buffer entries on this list are linked by their next and
 *              prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * dwl_tail_ptr:  Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked delayed write list.
 *              Page buffer entries on this list are linked by their next and
 *              prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * For VFD SWMR to function, copies of all pages modified during a tick must
 * be retained in the page buffer to allow correct updates to the index and
 * metadata file at the end of tick.
 *
 * To implement this, all entries modified during the current tick are placed
 * on the tick list.  Entries are removed from the tick list during end of
 * tick processing, so each tick starts with an empty tick list.
 *
 * Unless the entry also resides on the delayed write list, entries on the
 * tick list may be flushed, but they may not be evicted.
 *
 * Discussion of the fields used to implement the tick list follows:
 *
 * tl_len:      Number of page buffer entries currently on the tick list
 *
 * tl_size:     Number of bytes of page buffer entries currently residing
 *              on the tick list.
 *
 * tl_head_ptr:  Pointer to the head of the doubly linked tick list.
 *              Page buffer entries on this list are linked by their tl_next
 *              and tl_prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 * tl_tail_ptr:  Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked tick list.
 *              Page buffer entries on this list are linked by their tl_next
 *              and tl_prev fields.
 *
 *              This field is NULL if the list is empty.
 *
 *
 * STATISTICS:
 *
 * Multi-page metadata entries (which may only appear in VFD
 * SWMR mode) are NOT counted in the following statistics.
 *
 * Note that all statistics fields contain only data since the last time
 * that statistics were reset.
 *
 * bypasses:    Array of int64_t of length H5PB__NUM_STAT_TYPES containing
 *              the number of times that the page buffer has been

 *              metadata entries (VFD SWMR only) as indexed by 5PB__STATS_MD,

 *
 * hits:        Array of int64_t of length H5PB__NUM_STAT_TYPES containing

 *              indexed by 5PB__STATS_MD, H5PB__STATS_RD, and
 *              H5PB__STATS_MPMDE respectively.
 *
 * misses:      Array of int64_t of length H5PB__NUM_STAT_TYPES containing
 *              the number of page buffer misses for raw data, metadata,
 *              and for multi-page metadata entries (VFD SWMR only) as

 *              H5PB__STATS_MPMDE respectively.
 *
 * loads:       Array of int64_t of length H5PB__NUM_STAT_TYPES containing
 *              the number of page buffer loads for raw data, metadata,

 *              indexed by 5PB__STATS_MD, H5PB__STATS_RD, and
 *              H5PB__STATS_MPMDE respectively.
 *
 * flushes:     Array of int64_t of length H5PB__NUM_STAT_TYPES containing
 *              the number of page buffer flushes of raw data, metadata,
 *              and for multi-page metadata entries (VFD SWMR only) as
 *              indexed by 5PB__STATS_MD, H5PB__STATS_RD, and

 *
 * evictions:   Array of int64_t of length H5PB__NUM_STAT_TYPES containing
 *              the number of page buffer evictions of raw data, metadata,

 *              the LRU must be skipped if the number of metadata pages
 *              in the page buffer fails to exceed min_md_pages.
 *
 *              This int64_t is used to keep a count of these skips.
 *
 *              If this number becomes excessive, it will be necessary to
 *              add a holding tank for such entries.
 *
 * lru_rd_skips: When searching for an entry to evict, raw data entries on

 *
 *              This int64_t is used to keep a count of these skips.
 *
 *              If this number becomes excessive, it will be necessary to
 *              add a holding tank for such entries.
 *
 * Multi-page metadata entries (which appear only in VFD SWMR mode) are
 * listed in the hash take, and thus they are counted in the following
 * statistics.
 *
 * total_ht_insertions: Number of times entries have been inserted into the
 *              hash table.

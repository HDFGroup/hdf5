/**\defgroup H5A H5A
 * \brief Attribute Interface
 *
 * \details The Attribute Interface, H5A, provides a mechanism for attaching
 *          additional information to a dataset, group, or named datatype.
 *
 *          Attributes are accessed by opening the object that they are
 *          attached to and are not independent objects. Typically an
 *          attribute is small in size and contains user metadata about the
 *          object that it is attached to.
 *
 *          Attributes look similar to HDF5 datasets in that they have a
 *          datatype and dataspace. However, they do not support partial
 *          I/O operations and cannot be compressed or extended.

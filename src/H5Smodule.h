 * \brief Dataspace Interface
 *
 * \details The Dataspace Interface provides functions for creating and
 *          working with dataspaces.
 *
 *          A dataspace has two roles:
 *
 *          \li It contains the spatial information (logical layout) of a
 *              dataset stored in a file.
 *          \li It describes an applicationâ€™s data buffers and data elements
 *              participating in I/O. In other words, it can be used to
 *              select a portion or subset of a dataset.
 *
 *          The spatial information of a dataset in a file includes the
 *          rank and dimensions of the dataset, which are a permanent part
 *          of the dataset definition. It can have dimensions that are fixed
 *          (unchanging) or unlimited, which means they can grow in size
 *          (or are extendible).
 *
 *          A dataspace can consist of:
 *          \li  no elements (NULL)
 *          \li  a single element (scalar), or
 *          \li  a simple array.

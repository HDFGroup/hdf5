 * structure.
 *
 * Individual fields are:
 *
 * Read lock stats:
 *      read_locks_granted: The total number of read locks granted, including
 *              recursive lock requests.
 *
 *      read_locks_released: The total number of read locks released, including
 *              recursive lock requests.
 *
 *      real_read_locks_granted: The total number of read locks granted, less
 *              any recursive lock requests.
 *
 *      real_read_locks_released:  The total number of read locks released,
 *              less any recursive lock releases.
 *
 *      max_read_locks: The maximum number of read locks active at any point
 *              in time.
 *
 *      max_read_lock_recursion_depth: The maximum recursion depth observed
 *              for any read lock.
 *
 *      read_locks_delayed: The number of read locks not granted immediately.
 *
 *
 * Write lock stats:
 *      write_locks_granted: The total number of write locks granted,
 *              including recursive lock requests.
 *
 *      write_locks_released: The total number of write locks released,
 *              including recursive lock requests.
 *
 *      real_write_locks_granted: The total number of write locks granted,
 *              less any recursive lock requests.
 *
 *      real_write_locks_released: The total number of write locks released,
 *              less any recursive lock requests.
 *
 *      max_write_locks: The maximum number of write locks active at any point
 *              in time.  Must be either zero or one.
 *
 *      max_write_lock_recursion_depth: The maximum recursion depth observed
 *              for any write lock.
 *
 *      write_locks_delayed: The number of write locks not granted immediately.

 * Structure H5TS_rw_lock_t
 *
 * A recursive readers / writer (R/W) lock.
 *
 * This structure holds the fields needed to implement a recursive R/W lock
 * that allows recursive write locks, and for the associated statistics
 * collection fields.
 *
 * Note that we can't use the pthreads or Win32 R/W locks: they permit
 * recursive read locks, but disallow recursive write locks.
 *
 * Individual fields are:
 *
 * mutex:       Mutex used to maintain mutual exclusion on the fields of
 *              of this structure.
 *
 * lock_type:   Whether the lock is unused, a reader, or a writer.
 *
 * writers_cv:  Condition variable used for waiting writers.
 *
 * write_thread: The thread that owns a write lock, which is recursive
 *              for that thread.
 *
 * rec_write_lock_count: The # of recursive write locks outstanding
 *              for the thread that owns the write lock.
 *
 * waiting_writers_count: The count of waiting writers.
 *
 * readers_cv:  Condition variable used for waiting readers.
 *
 * reader_thread_count: The # of threads holding a read lock.
 *
 * rec_read_lock_count_key: Instance of thread-local key used to maintain
 *              a thread-specific recursive lock count for each thread
 *              holding a read lock.
 *
 * is_key_registered: Flag to track if the rec_read_lock_count_key has been
 *              registered yet for a lock.
 *
 * stats:       Instance of H5TS_rw_lock_stats_t used to track
 *              statistics on the recursive R/W lock.

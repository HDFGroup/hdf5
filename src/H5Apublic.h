 *          additional information as defined below, is passed to a
 *          user-defined function, \p op, which operates on that
 *          attribute.
 *
 *          The order of the iteration and the attributes iterated over
 *          are specified by three parameters: the index type,
 *          \p idx_type; the order in which the index is to be traversed,
 *          \p order; and the attributeâ€™s position in the index, \p idx.
 *

 *          by \p order, can be one of the following:
 *
 *          \orders
 *
 *          The next attribute to be operated on is specified by \p idx,
 *          a position in the index.
 *
 *          For example, if \p idx_type, \p order, and \p idx are set to
 *          #H5_INDEX_NAME, #H5_ITER_INC, and 5, respectively, the attribute
 *          in question is the fifth attribute from the beginning of the

 *          #H5_ITER_DEC, it would be the fifth attribute from the end of

 *

 *          one value and may be returned with another value. The value
 *          passed in identifies the parameter to be operated on first;
 *          the value returned identifies the parameter to be operated on
 *          in the next step of the iteration.
 *
 *          The #H5A_operator2_t prototype for the \p op parameter is a
 *          user defined function where:
 *          The operation receives the location identifier for the group or
 *          dataset being iterated over, \p location_id; the name of the

 *
 *          Valid return values from an operator and the resulting
 *          H5Aiterate2() and \p op behavior are as follows:

 *          \li Zero causes the iterator to continue, returning zero when
 *              all attributes have been processed.

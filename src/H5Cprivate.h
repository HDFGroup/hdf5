/****************************************************************************
 *
 * structure H5C_cache_entry_t
 *
 * Instances of the H5C_cache_entry_t structure are used to store cache
 * entries in a hash table and sometimes in a skip list.
 * See H5SL.c for the particulars of the skip list.
 *
 * In typical application, this structure is the first field in a
 * structure to be cached.  For historical reasons, the external module
 * is responsible for managing the is_dirty field (this is no longer
 * completely true.  See the comment on the is_dirty field for details).
 * All other fields are managed by the cache.
 *
 * The fields of this structure are discussed individually below:
 *
 *                        JRM - 4/26/04
 *
 * magic:    Unsigned 32 bit integer that must always be set to
 *              H5C__H5C_CACHE_ENTRY_T_MAGIC when the entry is valid.
 *              The field must be set to H5C__H5C_CACHE_ENTRY_T_BAD_MAGIC
 *              just before the entry is freed.
 *
 *              This is necessary, as the LRU list can be changed out
 *              from under H5C_make_space_in_cache() by the flush
 *              callback which may change the size of an existing entry,
 *              and/or load a new entry while serializing the target entry.
 *
 *              This in turn can cause a recursive call to
 *              H5C_make_space_in_cache() which may either flush or evict
 *              the next entry that the first invocation of that function
 *              was about to examine.
 *
 *              The magic field allows H5C_make_space_in_cache() to
 *              detect this case, and re-start its scan from the bottom
 *              of the LRU when this situation occurs.
 *
 *              This field is only compiled in debug mode.
 *
 * addr:    Base address of the cache entry on disk.
 *
 * size:    Length of the cache entry on disk.  Note that unlike normal
 *        caches, the entries in this cache are of variable length.
 *        The entries should never overlap, and when we do writebacks,
 *        we will want to writeback adjacent entries where possible.
 *
 *        NB: At present, entries need not be contiguous on disk.  Until
 *            we fix this, we can't do much with writing back adjacent
 *            entries.
 *
 * type:    Pointer to the instance of H5C_class_t containing pointers
 *        to the methods for cache entries of the current type.  This
 *        field should be NULL when the instance of H5C_cache_entry_t
 *        is not in use.
 *
 *        The name is not particularly descriptive, but is retained
 *        to avoid changes in existing code.
 *
 * is_dirty:    Boolean flag indicating whether the contents of the cache
 *        entry has been modified since the last time it was written
 *        to disk.
 *
 *        NOTE: For historical reasons, this field is not maintained
 *              by the cache.  Instead, the module using the cache
 *              sets this flag when it modifies the entry, and the
 *              flush and clear functions supplied by that module
 *              reset the dirty when appropriate.
 *
 *              This is a bit quirky, so we may want to change this
 *              someday.  However it will require a change in the
 *              cache interface.
 *
 *        Update: Management of the is_dirty field has been largely
 *              moved into the cache.  The only remaining exceptions
 *              are the flush and clear functions supplied by the
 *              modules using the cache.  These still clear the
 *              is_dirty field as before.  -- JRM 7/5/05
 *
 * dirtied:    Boolean flag used to indicate that the entry has been
 *         dirtied while protected.
 *
 *         This field is set to FALSE in the protect call, and may
 *         be set to TRUE by the
 *         H5C_mark_entry_dirty()
 *         call at an time prior to the unprotect call.
 *
 *         The H5C_mark_entry_dirty() call exists
 *         as a convenience function for the fractal heap code which
 *         may not know if an entry is protected or pinned, but knows
 *         that is either protected or pinned.  The dirtied field was
 *         added as in the parallel case, it is necessary to know
 *         whether a protected entry was dirty prior to the protect call.
 *
 * is_protected: Boolean flag indicating whether this entry is protected
 *        (or locked, to use more conventional terms).  When it is
 *        protected, the entry cannot be flushed or accessed until
 *        it is unprotected (or unlocked -- again to use more
 *        conventional terms).
 *
 *        Note that protected entries are removed from the LRU lists
 *        and inserted on the protected list.
 *
 * is_read_only: Boolean flag that is only meaningful if is_protected is
 *         TRUE.  In this circumstance, it indicates whether the
 *         entry has been protected read only, or read/write.
 *
 *         If the entry has been protected read only (i.e. is_protected
 *         and is_read_only are both TRUE), we allow the entry to be
 *         protected more than once.
 *
 *        In this case, the number of readers is maintained in the
 *        ro_ref_count field (see below), and unprotect calls simply
 *        decrement that field until it drops to zero, at which point
 *        the entry is actually unprotected.
 *
 * ro_ref_count: Integer field used to maintain a count of the number of
 *         outstanding read only protects on this entry.  This field
 *         must be zero whenever either is_protected or is_read_only
 *         are TRUE.
 *
 * is_pinned:    Boolean flag indicating whether the entry has been pinned
 *         in the cache.
 *
 *         For very hot entries, the protect / unprotect overhead
 *         can become excessive.  Thus the cache has been extended
 *         to allow an entry to be "pinned" in the cache.
 *
 *         Pinning an entry in the cache has several implications:
 *
 *         1) A pinned entry cannot be evicted.  Thus unprotected
 *            pinned entries must be stored in the pinned entry
 *            list, instead of being managed by the replacement
 *            policy code (LRU at present).
 *
 *         2) A pinned entry can be accessed or modified at any time.
 *            Therefore, the cache must check with the entry owner
 *            before flushing it.  If permission is denied, the
 *            cache does not flush the entry.
 *
 *         3) A pinned entry can be marked as dirty (and possibly
 *           change size) while it is unprotected.
 *
 *        4) The flush-destroy code must allow pinned entries to
 *           be unpinned (and possibly unprotected) during the
 *           flush.
 *
 *                               JRM -- 3/16/06
 *
 * in_slist:    Boolean flag indicating whether the entry is in the skip list
 *        As a general rule, entries are placed in the list when they
 *              are marked dirty.  However they may remain in the list after
 *              being flushed.
 *
 *              Update: Dirty entries are now removed from the skip list
 *            when they are flushed.
 *
 * flush_marker:  Boolean flag indicating that the entry is to be flushed
 *        the next time H5C_flush_cache() is called with the
 *        H5C__FLUSH_MARKED_ENTRIES_FLAG.  The flag is reset when
 *        the entry is flushed for whatever reason.
 *
 * clear_on_unprotect:  Boolean flag used only in PHDF5.  When H5C is used
 *        to implement the metadata cache In the parallel case, only
 *        the cache with mpi rank 0 is allowed to actually write to
 *        file -- all other caches must retain dirty entries until they
 *        are advised that the entry is clean.
 *
 *        This flag is used in the case that such an advisory is
 *        received when the entry is protected.  If it is set when an
 *        entry is unprotected, and the dirtied flag is not set in
 *        the unprotect, the entry's is_dirty flag is reset by flushing
 *        it with the H5C__FLUSH_CLEAR_ONLY_FLAG.
 *
 * flush_immediately:  Boolean flag used only in Phdf5 -- and then only
 *        for H5AC_METADATA_WRITE_STRATEGY__DISTRIBUTED.
 *
 *        When a distributed metadata write is triggered at a
 *        sync point, this field is used to mark entries that
 *        must be flushed before leaving the sync point.  At all
 *        other times, this field should be set to FALSE.
 *
 * flush_in_progress:  Boolean flag that is set to true iff the entry
 *         is in the process of being flushed.  This allows the cache
 *         to detect when a call is the result of a flush callback.
 *
 * destroy_in_progress:  Boolean flag that is set to true iff the entry
 *         is in the process of being flushed and destroyed.
 *
 * free_file_space_on_destroy:  Boolean flag that is set to true iff the entry
 *         is in the process of being flushed and destroyed and the file
 *              space used by the object should be freed by the cache client's
 *              'dest' callback routine.
 *
 *
 * Fields supporting the hash table:
 *
 * Fields in the cache are indexed by a more or less conventional hash table.
 * If there are multiple entries in any hash bin, they are stored in a doubly
 * linked list.
 *
 * ht_next:    Next pointer used by the hash table to store multiple
 *        entries in a single hash bin.  This field points to the
 *        next entry in the doubly linked list of entries in the
 *        hash bin, or NULL if there is no next entry.
 *
 * ht_prev:     Prev pointer used by the hash table to store multiple
 *              entries in a single hash bin.  This field points to the
 *              previous entry in the doubly linked list of entries in
 *        the hash bin, or NULL if there is no previuos entry.
 *
 *
 * Fields supporting replacement policies:
 *
 * The cache must have a replacement policy, and it will usually be
 * necessary for this structure to contain fields supporting that policy.
 *
 * While there has been interest in several replacement policies for
 * this cache, the initial development schedule is tight.  Thus I have
 * elected to support only a modified LRU policy for the first cut.
 *
 * When additional replacement policies are added, the fields in this
 * section will be used in different ways or not at all.  Thus the
 * documentation of these fields is repeated for each replacement policy.
 *
 * Modified LRU:
 *
 * When operating in parallel mode, we must ensure that a read does not
 * cause a write.  If it does, the process will hang, as the write will
 * be collective and the other processes will not know to participate.
 *
 * To deal with this issue, I have modified the usual LRU policy by adding
 * clean and dirty LRU lists to the usual LRU list.  When reading in
 * parallel mode, we evict from the clean LRU list only.  This implies
 * that we must try to ensure that the clean LRU list is reasonably well
 * stocked.  See the comments on H5C_t in H5Cpkg.h for more details.
 *
 * Note that even if we start with a completely clean cache, a sequence
 * of protects without unprotects can empty the clean LRU list.  In this
 * case, the cache must grow temporarily.  At the next write, we will
 * attempt to evict enough entries to get the cache down to its nominal
 * maximum size.
 *
 * The use of the replacement policy fields under the Modified LRU policy
 * is discussed below:
 *
 * next:    Next pointer in either the LRU or the protected list,
 *        depending on the current value of protected.  If there
 *        is no next entry on the list, this field should be set
 *        to NULL.
 *
 * prev:    Prev pointer in either the LRU or the protected list,
 *        depending on the current value of protected.  If there
 *        is no previous entry on the list, this field should be
 *        set to NULL.
 *
 * aux_next:    Next pointer on either the clean or dirty LRU lists.
 *        This entry should be NULL when protected is true.  When
 *        protected is false, and dirty is true, it should point
 *        to the next item on the dirty LRU list.  When protected
 *        is false, and dirty is false, it should point to the
 *        next item on the clean LRU list.  In either case, when
 *        there is no next item, it should be NULL.
 *
 * aux_prev:    Previous pointer on either the clean or dirty LRU lists.
 *        This entry should be NULL when protected is true.  When
 *        protected is false, and dirty is true, it should point
 *        to the previous item on the dirty LRU list.  When protected
 *        is false, and dirty is false, it should point to the
 *        previous item on the clean LRU list.  In either case, when
 *        there is no previous item, it should be NULL.
 *
 *
 * Fields supporting metadata journaling:
 *
 * last_trans:    unit64_t containing the ID of the last transaction in
 *         which this entry was dirtied.  If journaling is disabled,
 *         or if the entry has never been dirtied in a transaction,
 *         this field should be set to zero.  Once we notice that
 *         the specified transaction has made it to disk, we will
 *         reset this field to zero as well.
 *
 *         We must maintain this field, as to avoid messages from
 *         the future, we must not flush a dirty entry to disk
 *         until the last transaction in which it was dirtied
 *         has made it to disk in the journal file.
 *
 * trans_next:  Next pointer in the entries modified in the current
 *         transaction list.  This field should always be null
 *         unless journaling is enabled, the entry is dirty,
 *         and last_trans field contains the current transaction
 *         number.  Even if all these conditions are fulfilled,
 *         the field will still be NULL if this is the last
 *         entry on the list.
 *
 * trans_prev:  Previous pointer in the entries modified in the current
 *         transaction list.  This field should always be null
 *         unless journaling is enabled, the entry is dirty,
 *         and last_trans field contains the current transaction
 *         number.  Even if all these conditions are fulfilled,
 *         the field will still be NULL if this is the first
 *         entry on the list.
 *
 *
 * Cache entry stats collection fields:
 *
 * These fields should only be compiled in when both H5C_COLLECT_CACHE_STATS
 * and H5C_COLLECT_CACHE_ENTRY_STATS are true.  When present, they allow
 * collection of statistics on individual cache entries.
 *
 * accesses:    int32_t containing the number of times this cache entry has
 *        been referenced in its lifetime.
 *
 * clears:    int32_t containing the number of times this cache entry has
 *              been cleared in its life time.
 *
 * flushes:    int32_t containing the number of times this cache entry has
 *              been flushed to file in its life time.
 *
 * pins:    int32_t containing the number of times this cache entry has
 *         been pinned in cache in its life time.

 *
 * structure H5C_auto_size_ctl_t
 *
 * Instances of H5C_auto_size_ctl_t are used to get and set the control
 * fields for automatic cache re-sizing.
 *
 * The fields of the structure are discussed individually below:
 *
 * version: Integer field containing the version number of this version
 *    of the H5C_auto_size_ctl_t structure.  Any instance of
 *    H5C_auto_size_ctl_t passed to the cache must have a known
 *    version number, or an error will be flagged.
 *
 * report_fcn:  Pointer to the function that is to be called to report
 *      activities each time the auto cache resize code is executed.  If the
 *    field is NULL, no call is made.
 *
 *    If the field is not NULL, it must contain the address of a function
 *    of type H5C_auto_resize_report_fcn.
 *
 * set_initial_size: Boolean flag indicating whether the size of the
 *    initial size of the cache is to be set to the value given in
 *    the initial_size field.  If set_initial_size is FALSE, the
 *    initial_size field is ignored.
 *
 * initial_size: If enabled, this field contain the size the cache is
 *    to be set to upon receipt of this structure.  Needless to say,
 *    initial_size must lie in the closed interval [min_size, max_size].
 *
 * min_clean_fraction: double in the range 0 to 1 indicating the fraction
 *    of the cache that is to be kept clean.  This field is only used
 *    in parallel mode.  Typical values are 0.1 to 0.5.
 *
 * max_size: Maximum size to which the cache can be adjusted.  The
 *    supplied value must fall in the closed interval
 *    [MIN_MAX_CACHE_SIZE, MAX_MAX_CACHE_SIZE].  Also, max_size must
 *    be greater than or equal to min_size.
 *
 * min_size: Minimum size to which the cache can be adjusted.  The
 *      supplied value must fall in the closed interval
 *      [MIN_MAX_CACHE_SIZE, MAX_MAX_CACHE_SIZE].  Also, min_size must
 *    be less than or equal to max_size.
 *
 * epoch_length: Number of accesses on the cache over which to collect
 *    hit rate stats before running the automatic cache resize code,
 *      if it is enabled.
 *
 *    At the end of an epoch, we discard prior hit rate data and start
 *     collecting afresh.  The epoch_length must lie in the closed
 *    interval [H5C__MIN_AR_EPOCH_LENGTH, H5C__MAX_AR_EPOCH_LENGTH].
 *
 *
 * Cache size increase control fields:
 *
 * incr_mode: Instance of the H5C_cache_incr_mode enumerated type whose
 *    value indicates how we determine whether the cache size should be
 *    increased.  At present there are two possible values:
 *
 *    H5C_incr__off:    Don't attempt to increase the size of the cache
 *        automatically.
 *
 *        When this increment mode is selected, the remaining fields
 *        in the cache size increase section ar ignored.
 *
 *    H5C_incr__threshold: Attempt to increase the size of the cache
 *        whenever the average hit rate over the last epoch drops
 *        below the value supplied in the lower_hr_threshold
 *        field.
 *
 *        Note that this attempt will fail if the cache is already
 *        at its maximum size, or if the cache is not already using
 *        all available space.
 *
 * lower_hr_threshold: Lower hit rate threshold.  If the increment mode
 *    (incr_mode) is H5C_incr__threshold and the hit rate drops below the
 *    value supplied in this field in an epoch, increment the cache size by
 *    size_increment.  Note that cache size may not be incremented above
 *    max_size, and that the increment may be further restricted by the
 *    max_increment field if it is enabled.
 *
 *    When enabled, this field must contain a value in the range [0.0, 1.0].
 *    Depending on the incr_mode selected, it may also have to be less than
 *    upper_hr_threshold.
 *
 * increment:  Double containing the multiplier used to derive the new
 *    cache size from the old if a cache size increment is triggered.
 *      The increment must be greater than 1.0, and should not exceed 2.0.
 *
 *    The new cache size is obtained by multiplying the current max cache
 *    size by the increment, and then clamping to max_size and to stay
 *    within the max_increment as necessary.
 *
 * apply_max_increment:  Boolean flag indicating whether the max_increment
 *    field should be used to limit the maximum cache size increment.
 *
 * max_increment: If enabled by the apply_max_increment field described
 *    above, this field contains the maximum number of bytes by which the
 *    cache size can be increased in a single re-size.
 *
 * flash_incr_mode:  Instance of the H5C_cache_flash_incr_mode enumerated
 *      type whose value indicates whether and by what algorithm we should
 *      make flash increases in the size of the cache to accommodate insertion
 *      of large entries and large increases in the size of a single entry.
 *
 *      The addition of the flash increment mode was occasioned by performance
 *      problems that appear when a local heap is increased to a size in excess
 *      of the current cache size.  While the existing re-size code dealt with
 *      this eventually, performance was very bad for the remainder of the
 *      epoch.
 *
 *      At present, there are two possible values for the flash_incr_mode:
 *
 *      H5C_flash_incr__off:  Don't perform flash increases in the size of
 *              the cache.
 *
 *      H5C_flash_incr__add_space:  Let x be either the size of a newly
 *              newly inserted entry, or the number of bytes by which the
 *              size of an existing entry has been increased.
 *
 *              If
 *                   x > flash_threshold * current max cache size,
 *
 *              increase the current maximum cache size by x * flash_multiple
 *              less any free space in the cache, and start a new epoch.  For
 *              now at least, pay no attention to the maximum increment.
 *
 *
 *      With a little thought, it should be obvious that the above flash
 *      cache size increase algorithm is not sufficient for all
 *      circumstances -- for example, suppose the user round robins through
 *      (1/flash_threshold) +1 groups, adding one data set to each on each
 *      pass.  Then all will increase in size at about the same time, requiring
 *      the max cache size to at least double to maintain acceptable
 *      performance, however the above flash increment algorithm will not be
 *      triggered.
 *
 *      Hopefully, the add space algorithm detailed above will be sufficient
 *      for the performance problems encountered to date.  However, we should
 *      expect to revisit the issue.
 *
 * flash_multiple: Double containing the multiple described above in the
 *      H5C_flash_incr__add_space section of the discussion of the
 *      flash_incr_mode section.  This field is ignored unless flash_incr_mode
 *      is H5C_flash_incr__add_space.
 *
 * flash_threshold: Double containing the factor by which current max cache
 *     size is multiplied to obtain the size threshold for the add_space
 *     flash increment algorithm.  The field is ignored unless
 *     flash_incr_mode is H5C_flash_incr__add_space.
 *
 *
 * Cache size decrease control fields:
 *
 * decr_mode: Instance of the H5C_cache_decr_mode enumerated type whose
 *    value indicates how we determine whether the cache size should be
 *    decreased.  At present there are four possibilities.
 *
 *    H5C_decr__off:    Don't attempt to decrease the size of the cache
 *        automatically.
 *
 *        When this increment mode is selected, the remaining fields
 *        in the cache size decrease section are ignored.
 *
 *    H5C_decr__threshold: Attempt to decrease the size of the cache
 *        whenever the average hit rate over the last epoch rises
 *        above the value    supplied in the upper_hr_threshold
 *        field.
 *
 *    H5C_decr__age_out:  At the end of each epoch, search the cache for
 *        entries that have not been accessed for at least the number
 *        of epochs specified in the epochs_before_eviction field, and
 *        evict these entries.  Conceptually, the maximum cache size
 *        is then decreased to match the new actual cache size.  However,
 *        this reduction may be modified by the min_size, the
 *        max_decrement, and/or the empty_reserve.
 *
 *    H5C_decr__age_out_with_threshold:  Same as age_out, but we only
 *        attempt to reduce the cache size when the hit rate observed
 *        over the last epoch exceeds the value provided in the
 *        upper_hr_threshold field.
 *
 * upper_hr_threshold: Upper hit rate threshold.  The use of this field
 *    varies according to the current decr_mode:
 *
 *    H5C_decr__off or H5C_decr__age_out:  The value of this field is
 *        ignored.
 *
 *    H5C_decr__threshold:  If the hit rate exceeds this threshold in any
 *        epoch, attempt to decrement the cache size by size_decrement.
 *
 *        Note that cache size may not be decremented below min_size.
 *
 *        Note also that if the upper_threshold is 1.0, the cache size
 *        will never be reduced.
 *
 *    H5C_decr__age_out_with_threshold:  If the hit rate exceeds this
 *        threshold in any epoch, attempt to reduce the cache size
 *        by evicting entries that have not been accessed for more
 *        than the specified number of epochs.
 *
 * decrement: This field is only used when the decr_mode is
 *    H5C_decr__threshold.
 *
 *    The field is a double containing the multiplier used to derive the
 *    new cache size from the old if a cache size decrement is triggered.
 *    The decrement must be in the range 0.0 (in which case the cache will
 *      try to contract to its minimum size) to 1.0 (in which case the
 *      cache will never shrink).
 *
 * apply_max_decrement:  Boolean flag used to determine whether decrements
 *    in cache size are to be limited by the max_decrement field.
 *
 * max_decrement: Maximum number of bytes by which the cache size can be
 *    decreased in a single re-size.  Note that decrements may also be
 *    restricted by the min_size of the cache, and (in age out modes) by
 *    the empty_reserve field.
 *
 * epochs_before_eviction:  Integer field used in H5C_decr__age_out and
 *    H5C_decr__age_out_with_threshold decrement modes.
 *
 *    This field contains the number of epochs an entry must remain
 *    unaccessed before it is evicted in an attempt to reduce the
 *    cache size.  If applicable, this field must lie in the range
 *    [1, H5C__MAX_EPOCH_MARKERS].
 *
 * apply_empty_reserve:  Boolean field controlling whether the empty_reserve
 *    field is to be used in computing the new cache size when the
 *    decr_mode is H5C_decr__age_out or H5C_decr__age_out_with_threshold.
 *
 * empty_reserve:  To avoid a constant racheting down of cache size by small
 *    amounts in the H5C_decr__age_out and H5C_decr__age_out_with_threshold
 *    modes, this field allows one to require that any cache size
 *    reductions leave the specified fraction of unused space in the cache.
 *
 *    The value of this field must be in the range [0.0, 1.0].  I would
 *    expect typical values to be in the range of 0.01 to 0.1.

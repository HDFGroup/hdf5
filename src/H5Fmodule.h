 * Use the functions in this module to manage HDF5 files.
 *
 * In the code snippets below, we show the skeletal life cycle of an HDF5 file,
 * when creating a new file (left) or when opening an existing file (right).
 * File creation is essentially controlled through \ref FCPL, and file access to
 * new and existing files is controlled through \ref FAPL. The file \c name and
 * creation or access \c mode control the interaction with the underlying
 * storage such as file systems.
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Create</th><th>Read</th></tr>
 * <tr valign="top">
 *   <td>
 *   \snippet{lineno} H5F_examples.c create
 *   </td>
 *   <td>
 *   \snippet{lineno} H5F_examples.c read
 *   </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr><th>Update</th><th>Delete</th></tr>
 * <tr valign="top">

 *   </td>
 *   <td>
 *   \snippet{lineno} H5F_examples.c delete
 *   </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * In addition to general file management functions, there are three categories
 * of functions that deal with advanced file management tasks and use cases:
 * 1. The control of the HDF5 \ref MDC
 * 2. The use of (MPI-) \ref PH5F HDF5
 * 3. The \ref SWMR pattern
 *
 * \defgroup MDC Metadata Cache

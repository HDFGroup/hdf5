/****************************************************************************
 *
 * Structure: H5FD_subfiling_config_t
 *
 * Purpose:
 *
 *     H5FD_subfiling_config_t is a public structure that is used to pass
 *     subfiling configuration data to the appropriate subfiling VFD via
 *     the FAPL.  A pointer to an instance of this structure is a parameter
 *     to H5Pset_fapl_subfiling() and H5Pget_fapl_subfiling().
 *
 * `magic`   (uint32_t)
 *
 *     Magic is a somewhat unique number which identifies this VFD from
 *     other VFDs.  Used in combination with a version number, we can
 *     validate a user generated file access property list (fapl).
 *     This field should be set to H5FD_SUBFILING_FAPL_MAGIC.
 *
 * `version` (uint32_t)
 *
 *     Version number of the H5FD_subfiling_config_t structure.  Any instance
 *     passed to the above calls must have a recognized version number, or
 *     an error will be flagged.
 *
 *     This field should be set to H5FD_CURR_SUBFILING_FAPL_VERSION.
 *
 ***   IO Concentrator Info ***
 ***   These fields will be replicated in the stacked IOC VFD which
 ***   provides the extended support for aggregating reads and writes
 ***   and allows global file access to node-local storage containers.
 *
 * `stripe_count` (int32_t)
 *
 *     The integer value which identifies the total number of
 *     subfiles that have been algorithmically been selected to
 *     to contain the segments of raw data which make up an HDF5
 *     file.  This value is used to implement the RAID-0 functionality
 *     when reading or writing datasets.
 *
 * `stripe_depth` (int64_t)
 *
 *     The stripe depth defines a limit on the maximum number of contiguous
 *     bytes that can be read or written in a single operation on any
 *     selected subfile.  Larger IO operations can exceed this limit
 *     by utilizing MPI derived types to construct an IO request which
 *     gathers additional data segments from memory for the IO request.
 *
 * `ioc_selection` (enum io_selection datatype)
 *
 *     The io_selection_t defines a specific algorithm by which IO
 *     concentrators (IOCs) and sub-files are identified.  The available
 *     algorithms are: SELECT_IOC_ONE_PER_NODE, SELECT_IOC_EVERY_NTH_RANK,
 *     SELECT_IOC_WITH_CONFIG, and SELECT_IOC_TOTAL.
 *
 ***   STACKING and other VFD support
 ***   i.e. FAPL caching
 ***
 *
 * `ioc_fapl_id` (hid_t)
 *
 *     A valid file access property list (fapl) is cached on each
 *     process and thus enables selection of an alternative provider
 *     for subsequent file operations.
 *     By default, Sub-filing employs an additional support VFD that
 *     provides file IO proxy capabilities to all MPI ranks in a
 *     distributed parallel application.  This IO indirection
 *     thus allows application access all sub-files even while
 *     these may actually be node-local and thus not directly
 *     accessible to remote ranks.
 *
 ****************************************************************************/

/*
 * In addition to the common configuration fields, we can have
 * VFD specific fields.  Here's one for the subfiling VFD.
 *
 * `require_ioc` (hbool_t)
 *
 *     Require_IOC is a boolean flag with a default value of TRUE.
 *     This flag indicates that the stacked H5FDioc VFD should be
 *     employed for sub-filing operations.  The default flag can be
 *     overridden with an environment variable: H5_REQUIRE_IOC=0
 *

-Werror=cast-function-type
#
# For GCC 8, promote maybe-initialized warnings to an error.  GCC 8
# reports 0 maybe-uninitialized warnings where earlier versions
# make many false reports.  GCC 8 seems to analyze calls to static
# in order to detect initializations that occur there.  It's possible
# that GCC 8 only performs that analysis at -O3, though.
#
-Werror=maybe-uninitialized
# Ask GCC to warn about cast-align problems, even on platforms where
# it normally wouldn't (because those platforms don't require alignment).
# While this flag doesn't follow the -Werror format like above, it's
# placed here to make sure that it comes after the -Werror=cast-align
# line from error-general in the list of flags. Otherwise, if the
# '--enable-warnings-as-errors' flag isn't passed at configure time,
# the logic in config/gnu-flags that demotes these errors to their
# normal warning form will cause -Wcast-align to come after
# -Wcast-align=strict in the list of flags, causing it to take
# precedence and mask cast-align warnings from GCC on certain platforms.
-Wcast-align=strict

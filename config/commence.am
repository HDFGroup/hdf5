# Shell commands used in Makefiles
RM=rm -f
CP=cp

# Hardcode SHELL to be /bin/sh.  Most machines have this shell, and
# on at least one machine configure fails to detect its existence (janus).
# Also, when HDF5 is configured on one machine but run on another,
# configure's automatic SHELL detection may not work on the build machine.
SHELL=/bin/sh

# Some machines need a command to run executables; this is that command
# so that our tests will run.
# We use RUNTESTS instead of RUNSERIAL directly because it may be that
# some tests need to be run with a different command.  Older versions
# of the makefiles used the command
# $(LIBTOOL) --mode=execute
# in some directories, for instance.
RUNTESTS=$(RUNSERIAL)

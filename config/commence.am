# so that our tests will run.
# We use RUNEXEC instead of RUNSERIAL directly because it may be that
# some tests need to be run with a different command.  Older versions
# of the makefiles used the command
# $(LIBTOOL) --mode=execute
# in some directories, for instance.

# Note that in svn revision 19400 the '/' after DESTDIR in H5* variables below
# has been removed. According to the official description of DESTDIR by Gnu at
# http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html, DESTDIR is
# prepended to the normal and complete install path that it precedes for the
# purpose of installing in a temporary directory which is useful for building
# rpms and other packages.  The '/' after ${DESTDIR} will be followed by another
# '/' at the beginning of the normal install path.  When DESTDIR is empty the
# path then begins with '//', which is incorrect and causes problems at least for
# Cygwin.

#
# This file is part of the HDF5 build script.  It is processed shortly
# after configure starts and defines, among other things, flags for
# the various compile modes.


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compiler flags. The CPPFLAGS values should not include package debug
# flags like `-DH5G_DEBUG' since these are added with the
# `--enable-debug' switch of configure.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Choosing a C Compiler
# ---------------------
#
# Configre will use the value of environment variable `CC' if it is
# set.  If not then configure checks for a working GNU `gcc' followed
# by other common compiler names.  If a default compiler is desired
# then uncomment the following line, replacing `gcc' with the name of
# the default compiler.

#CC=${CC:-gcc}




# C Compiler and Preprocessor Flags
# ---------------------------------
#
# Flags that end with `_CFLAGS' are always passed to the compiler.
# Flags that end with `_CPPFLAGS' are passed to the compiler when
# compiling but not when linking.
#
# DEBUG_CFLAGS		Flags to pass to the compiler to create a
# DEBUG_CPPFLAGS	library suitable for use with debugging
#			tools. Usually this list will exclude
#			optimization switches (like `-O') and include
#			switches that turn on symbolic debugging
#			support (like `-g').
#
# PROD_CFLAGS		Flags to pass to the compiler to create a
# PROD_CPPFLAGS		production version of the library.  These
#			usualy exclude symbolic debugging switches
#			(like `-g') and include optimization switches
#			(like `-O').
#
# PROFILE_CFLAGS	Flags to pass to the compiler to create a
# PROFILE_CPPFLAGS	library suitable for performance testing (like 
# 			`-pg').  This may or may not include debugging 
# 			or production flags.
#			
# CFLAGS		Flags can be added to this variable which
#			might already be partially initialized.  These 
#			flags will always be passed to the compiler
#			and should include switches to turn on full
#			warnings.  HDF5 attempts to be ANSI and Posix
#			compliant and employ good programming
#			practices resulting in few if any
#			warnings. Note: warning flags do not have to
#			be added to this variable if the compiler is
#			the GNU gcc compiler or a descendent of gcc.

# Overriding Configure Tests
# --------------------------
#
# Values for overriding configuration tests when cross compiling.
# This includes compiling on some machines where the serial front end
# compiles for a parallel back end.

# Set this to `yes' or `no' depending on whether the target is big
# endian or little endian.
#ac_cv_c_bigendian=${ac_cv_c_bigendian='yes'}

# Set this to the width required by printf() to print type `long
# long'.  For instance, if the format would be `%lld' then set it to
# `ll' or if the format would be `%qd' set it to `q'.
#hdf5_cv_printf_ll=${hdf5_cv_printf_ll='ll'}

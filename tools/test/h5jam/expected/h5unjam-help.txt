usage: h5unjam -i <in_file.h5>  [-o <out_file.h5> ] [-u <out_user_file> | --delete]

Splits user file and HDF5 file into two files: user block data and HDF5 data.

OPTIONS
  -i in_file.h5   Specifies the HDF5 as input.  If the input HDF5 file
                  contains no user block, exit with an error message.
  -o out_file.h5  Specifies output HDF5 file without a user block.
                  If not specified, the user block will be removed from the
                  input HDF5 file.
  -u out_user_file
                  Specifies the output file containing the data from the
                  user block.
                  Cannot be used with --delete option.
  --delete        Remove the user block from the input HDF5 file. The content
                  of the user block is discarded.
                  Cannot be used with the -u option.

  -h              Prints a usage message and exits.

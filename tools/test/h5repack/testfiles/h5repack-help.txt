    BOUND is an integer indicating the library release versions to use when

        0: This is H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST in H5F_libver_t struct

           (H5F_LIBVER_LATEST is aliased to H5F_LIBVER_V110 for this release

    FS_STRATEGY is a string indicating the file space strategy used:
        FSM_AGGR:
               The mechanisms used in managing file space are free-space
               managers, aggregators and virtual file driver.
        PAGE:
               The mechanisms used in managing file space are free-space
               managers with embedded paged aggregation and virtual file driver.
        AGGR:
               The mechanisms used in managing file space are aggregators and
               virtual file driver.
        NONE:
               The mechanisms used in managing file space are virtual file
               driver.
        The default strategy when not set is FSM_AGGR without persisting free-
        space.

    FS_PERSIST is 1 to persisting free-space or 0 to not persisting free-space.
      The default when not set is not persisting free-space.
      The value is ignored for AGGR and NONE strategies.

    FS_THRESHOLD is the minimum size (in bytes) of free-space sections to be
        tracked by the library.
      The default when not set is 1.
      The value is ignored for AGGR and NONE strategies.

    FS_PAGESIZE is the size (in bytes) >=512 that is used by the library when
        the file space strategy PAGE is used.
      The default when not set is 4096.

    FILT - is a string with the format:

      <list of objects>:<name of filter>=<filter parameters>

      <list of objects> is a comma separated list of object names, meaning apply
        compression only to those objects. If no names are specified, the filter
        is applied to all objects
      <name of filter> can be:
        GZIP, to apply the HDF5 GZIP filter (GZIP compression)
        SZIP, to apply the HDF5 SZIP filter (SZIP compression)
        SHUF, to apply the HDF5 shuffle filter
        FLET, to apply the HDF5 checksum filter
        NBIT, to apply the HDF5 NBIT filter (NBIT compression)
        SOFF, to apply the HDF5 Scale/Offset filter
        UD,   to apply a user defined filter
        NONE, to remove all filters
      <filter parameters> is optional filter parameter information
        GZIP=<deflation level> from 1-9
        SZIP=<pixels per block,coding> pixels per block is a even number in
            2-32 and coding method is either EC or NN
        SHUF (no parameter)
        FLET (no parameter)
        NBIT (no parameter)
        SOFF=<scale_factor,scale_type> scale_factor is an integer and scale_type
            is either IN or DS
        UD=<filter_number,filter_flag,cd_value_count,value1[,value2,...,valueN]>
            Required values: filter_number, filter_flag, cd_value_count, value1
            Optional values: value2 to valueN
        NONE (no parameter)

    LAYT - is a string with the format:

      <list of objects>:<layout type>=<layout parameters>

      <list of objects> is a comma separated list of object names, meaning that
        layout information is supplied for those objects. If no names are
        specified, the layout type is applied to all objects
      <layout type> can be:
        CHUNK, to apply chunking layout
        COMPA, to apply compact layout
        CONTI, to apply contiguous layout
      <layout parameters> is optional layout information
        CHUNK=DIM[xDIM...xDIM], the chunk size of each dimension
        COMPA (no parameter)
        CONTI (no parameter)

   GZIP compression with level 1 to all objects

2) h5repack -v -f dset1:SZIP=8,NN file1 file2

   SZIP compression with 8 pixels per block and NN coding method to object dset1

3) h5repack -v -l dset1,dset2:CHUNK=20x10 -f dset3,dset4,dset5:NONE file1 file2

   Chunked layout, with a layout size of 20x10, to objects dset1 and dset2
   and remove filters to objects dset3, dset4, dset5

4) h5repack -L -c 10 -s 20:dtype file1 file2

   Using latest file format with maximum compact group size of 10 and
   minimum shared datatype size of 20

5) h5repack -f SHUF -f GZIP=1 file1 file2

   Add both filters SHUF and GZIP in this order to all datasets

6) h5repack -f UD=307,0,1,9 file1 file2

   Add bzip2 filter to all datasets

7) h5repack --low=0 --high=1 file1 file2

   Set low=H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST and high=H5F_LIBVER_V18 via
   H5Pset_libver_bounds() when creating the repacked file, file2

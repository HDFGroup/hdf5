     *
     *   raw:        If set then print all data as hexadecimal without
     *               performing any conversion from disk.
     *
     *   fmt_raw:    The printf() format for each byte of raw data. The
     *               default is `%02x'.
     *

     *
     *   fmt_uint:   The printf() format to use when rendering data which is

     *
     *   fmt_schar:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *               typed `signed char'. The default is `%d'. This format is
     *               used ony if the `ascii' field is zero.
     *
     *   fmt_uchar:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *               typed `unsigned char'. The default is `%u'. This format
     *               is used only if the `ascii' field is zero.
     *
     *   fmt_short:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *               typed `short'. The default is `%d'.

     *
     *   fmt_ulong:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *               typed `unsigned long'. The default is `%lu'.
     *
     *   fmt_llong:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *               typed `long long'. The default depends on what printf()
     *               format is available to print this datatype.
     *
     *   fmt_ullong: The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *               typed `unsigned long long'. The default depends on what
     *               printf() format is available to print this datatype.
     *
     *   fmt_double: The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *               typed `double'. The default is `%g'.
     *
     *   fmt_float:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *               typed `float'. The default is `%g'.
     *
     *   ascii:      If set then print 1-byte integer values as an ASCII
     *               character (no quotes).  If the character is one of the
     *               standard C escapes then print the escaped version.  If
     *               the character is unprintable then print a 3-digit octal
     *               escape.  If `ascii' is zero then then 1-byte integers are
     *               printed as numeric values.  The default is zero.
     *
     *   str_locale: Determines how strings are printed. If zero then strings
     *               are printed like in C except. If set to ESCAPE_HTML then
     *               strings are printed using HTML encoding where each
     *               character not in the class [a-zA-Z0-9] is substituted
     *               with `%XX' where `X' is a hexadecimal digit.
     *
     *   str_repeat: If set to non-zero then any character value repeated N
     *               or more times is printed as 'C'*N
     *
     * Numeric data is also subject to the formats for individual elements.

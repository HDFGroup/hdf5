<-n h5diff_basic1.h5> is not a valid option
usage: h5diff [OPTIONS] file1 file2 [obj1[obj2]] 

file1             File name of the first HDF5 file
file2             File name of the second HDF5 file
[obj1]            Name of an HDF5 object, in absolute path
[obj2]            Name of an HDF5 object, in absolute path
[OPTIONS] are:
[-h]              Print out this information
[-V]              Print HDF5 library version number and exit
[-r]              Report mode. Print differences
[-v]              Verbose mode. Print differences, list of objects, warnings
[-q]              Quiet mode. Do not do output
[-n count]        Print difference up to count number
[-d delta]        Print difference when it is greater than limit delta
[-p relative]     Print difference when it is greater than a relative limit

Items in [] are optional
[obj1] and [obj2] are HDF5 objects (datasets, groups, datatypes or links)
The 'count' value must be a positive integer
The 'delta' and 'relative' values must be positive numbers
The -d compare criteria is |a - b| > delta
The -p compare criteria is |(b-a)/a| > relative

h5diff has four modes of output:
 Normal mode: print the number of differences found and where they occured
 Report mode: print the above plus the differences
 Verbose mode: print the above plus a list of objects and warnings
 Quiet mode: do not print output (h5diff always returns an exit code of 1 when differences are found)

Examples of use:

1) h5diff file1 file2 /g1/dset1 /g1/dset2

   Compares object '/g1/dset1' in file1 with '/g1/dset2' in file2

2) h5diff file1 file2 /g1/dset1

   Compares object '/g1/dset1' in both files

3) h5diff file1 file2

   Compares all objects in both files

Note)  file1 and file2 can be the same file. Use

   h5diff file1 file1 /g1/dset1 /g1/dset2

   to compare '/g1/dset1' and '/g1/dset2' in the same file

If no objects are specified, h5diff only compares objects with the same absolute path in both files. The compare criteria is: 1) datasets: numerical array differences 2) groups: name string difference 3) datatypes: the return value of H5Tequal 2) links: name string difference of the linked value

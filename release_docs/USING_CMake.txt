* Build and Install HDF5 Applications with CMake                           *
************************************************************************

Notes: This short instruction is written for users who want to quickly build 
       HDF5 Applications from the HDF5 Examples package using the CMake tools.
       Users can adapt these instructions for their own applications, see the 
       "Minimum Project Files" section.
       
       More information about using CMake can be found at the KitWare site, 
       www.cmake.org.
         
       CMake uses the command line, however the visual CMake tool is 
       available for the configuration step. The steps are similar for
       all the operating systems supported by CMake.
       
       NOTES:
         1. Using CMake for building and using HDF5 is under active development. 
            While we have attempted to provide error-free files, please 
            understand that development with CMake has not been extensively 
            tested outside of HDF. The CMake specific files may change
            before the next release.
            
         2. CMake was originally introduced to support development on Windows, 
            however it should be usable on any system where CMake is supported. 
            Please send us any comments on how CMake support can be improved on 
            any system. Visit the KitWare site for more information about CMake.
            
         3. HDF5 library build and test results can be submitted to our CDash server at:
            cdash.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu. 
            Please read the HDF and CDash document at:
            www.hdfgroup.org/CDash/HowToSubmit.

                            Preconditions                                                           
========================================================================                          

   1. We suggest you obtain the latest CMake for windows from the Kitware
      web site. The HDF5 1.8.x product requires CMake version 2.8.10 (minimum).                     
                                                                         
   2. You have installed the HDF5 library built with CMake, by executing the
      HDF Install Utility (The *.exe file in the binary package for Windows). 
      If you are using a Windows platform, you can obtain a pre-built Windows 
      binary from The HDF Group's website at www.hdfgroup.org.

   3. On Windows with Visual Studio, if you have installed the static HDF5
      library, you will need to add the HDF5\lib folder to the library
      search list. See the "Using Static Libraries with Visual Studio" section.
 
   4. Set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT to the installed location of HDF5.
      On Windows HDF5_ROOT=C:\Program Files\HDF Group\HDF5\hdf5-1.8.x
      (Note there are no quote characters used on windows)
                                                                         
========================================================================
          Building HDF5 Applications with CMake
========================================================================

   1. Run CMake

      The CMake executable is named "cmake-gui.exe" on Windows and should be
      available in your Start menu. For Linux, UNIX, and Mac users the
      executable is named "cmake-gui" and can be found where CMake was 
      installed. 
      Specify the source and build directories. It is recommended that you 
      choose a build directory different then the source directory 
      (for example on Windows, if the source is at c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5, then
      use c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\build or c:\MyHDFstuff\build\hdf5). 
      
      OPTIONAL:
        Users can perform the configuration step without using the visual cmake-gui
        program. Example configuration step executed within the build directory:
        
        cmake -G "<generator>"  [-D<options>]  <sourcepath>
        
        Where <generator> is    
            * Borland Makefiles
            * MSYS Makefiles
            * MinGW Makefiles
            * NMake Makefiles
            * Unix Makefiles
            * Visual Studio 10
            * Visual Studio 10 Win64
            * Visual Studio 6
            * Visual Studio 7
            * Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003
            * Visual Studio 8 2005
            * Visual Studio 8 2005 Win64
            * Visual Studio 9 2008
            * Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64

        <options> is:
            * BUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON
            * USE_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=[ON | OFF]

   2. Configure the cache settings

      2.1  Click the Configure button. If this is the first time you are 
           running cmake-gui in this directory, you will be prompted for the 
           generator you wish to use (for example on Windows, Visual Studio 9 2008). 
           CMake will read in the CMakeLists.txt files from the source directory and 
           display options for the HDF5 project. After the first configure you 
           can adjust the cache settings and/or specify locations of other programs.
      
           Any conflicts or new values will be highlighted by the configure
           process in red. Once you are happy with all the settings and there are no 
           more values in red, click the Generate button to produce the appropriate 
           build files. 
      
           On Windows, if you are using a Visual Studio generator, the solution and 
           project files will be created in the build folder.
      
           On linux, if you are using the Unix Makefiles generator, the Makefiles will
           be created in the build folder.

      2.2  Alternative command line example on Windows in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\build directory:
      
           cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON -DUSE_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON ..

   3. Build HDF5 Applications
   
      On Windows, you can build HDF5 applications using either the Visual Studio Environment 
      or the command line. The command line is normally used on linux, Unix, and Mac.

      To build from the command line, navigate to your build directory and
      execute the following;
          
              cmake --build . --config {Debug | Release}     
              
      NOTE: "--config {Debug | Release}" may be optional on your platform. We
            recommend choosing either Debug or Release on Windows. If you are
            using the pre-built binaries from HDF, use Release.                                                                                     
             
      3.1  If you wish to use the Visual Studio environment, open the solution 
           file in your build directory. Be sure to select either Debug or 
           Release and build the solution.
             
   4. Test HDF5 Applications.

      To test the build, navigate to your build directory and execute;
      
              ctest . -C {Debug | Release}
              
      NOTE: "-C {Debug | Release}" may be optional on your platform. We
            recommend choosing either Debug or Release to match the build
            step on Windows.                                                                                      

   6. The files that support building with CMake are all the files in the 
      config/cmake folder, the CMakeLists.txt files in each source folder, and 
      CTestConfig.cmake. CTestConfig.cmake is specific to the internal testing 
      performed by The HDF Group. It should be altered for the users 
      installation and needs.

   7. More information about using CMake can be found at the KitWare site, 
      www.cmake.org.

========================================================================

   8. Set up path for external libraries and headers

      Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio and go to "Tools" and select "Options", 
      find "Projects", and then "VC++ Directories".
      
      8.1 If you are building on 64-bit Windows, find the "Platform" dropdown
          and select "x64".

      8.2 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Include files", add the 
          header path (i.e. c:\Program Files\HDF Group\HDF5\hdf5-1.8.x\include)
          to the included directories.

      8.3 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files", add the
          library path (i.e. c:\Program Files\HDF Group\HDF5\hdf5-1.8.x\lib)
          to the library directories.
          
      8.4 If using Fortran libraries, you will also need to setup the path
          for the Intel Fortran compiler.

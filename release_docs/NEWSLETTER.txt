* Added support for _Float16 16-bit floating-point datatype

  Support for the 16-bit floating-point _Float16 C type has been added to
  HDF5. On platforms where this type is available, this can enable more
  efficient storage of floating-point data when an application doesn't
  need the precision of larger floating-point datatypes. It can also allow
  for improved performance when converting between 16-bit floating-point
  data and data of another HDF5 datatype.

New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    - Refactored the utils folder.

      Added subfolder test and moved the 'swmr_check_compat_vfd.c file'
      from test into utils/test. Deleted the duplicate swmr_check_compat_vfd.c
      file in hl/tools/h5watch folder. Also fixed vfd check options.

      (ADB - 2021/10/18)

    - Changed autotools and CMake configurations to derive both
      compilation warnings-as-errors and warnings-only-warn configurations
      from the same files, 'config/*/*error*'.  Removed redundant files
      'config/*/*noerror*'.

      (DCY - 2021/09/29)

    - Added new option to control the build of High-Level tools
      that default ON/enabled.

      Add configure options (autotools - CMake):
            enable-hltools       HDF5_BUILD_HL_TOOLS

      (ADB - 2021/09/16, HDFFV-11266)

    - CMake will now run the shell script tests in test/ by default

      The test directory includes several shell script tests that previously
      were not run by CMake. These are now run by default. TEST_SHELL_SCRIPTS
      has been set to ON and SH_PROGRAM has been set to bash (some test
      scripts use bash-isms). Platforms without bash (e.g., Windows) will
      ignore the script tests.

      (DER - 2021/05/23)

    - Removed unused HDF5_ENABLE_HSIZET option from CMake

      This has been unused for some time and has no effect.

      (DER - 2021/05/23)

    - Add CMake variable HDF5_LIB_INFIX

      This infix is added to all library names after 'hdf5'.
      e.g. the infix '_openmpi' results in the library name 'libhdf5_openmpi.so'
      This name is used in packages on debian based systems.
      (see https://packages.debian.org/jessie/amd64/libhdf5-openmpi-8/filelist)

      (barcode - 2021/03/22)


    Library:
    --------
    - Change how the release part of version, in major.minor.release is checked
      for compatibility

      The HDF5 library uses a function, H5check_version, to check that
      the version defined in the header files, which is used to compile an
      application is compatible with the version codified in the library, which
      the application loads at runtime. This previously required an exact match
      or the library would print a warning, dump the build settings and then
      abort or continue. An environment variable controlled the logic.

      Now the function first checks that the library release version, in
      major.minor.release, is not older than the version in the headers.
      Secondly, if the release version is different, it checks if either
      the library version or the header version is in the exception list, in
      which case the release part of version, in major.minor.release, must
      be exact. An environment variable still controls the logic.

        (ADB - 2021/07/27)

    - H5Gcreate1() now rejects size_hint parameters larger than UINT32_MAX

      The size_hint value is ultimately stored in a uint32_t struct field,
      so specifying a value larger than this on a 64-bit machine can cause
      undefined behavior including crashing the system.

      The documentation for this API call was also incorrect, stating that
      passing a negative value would cause the library to use a default
      value. Instead, passing a "negative" value actually passes a very large
      value, which is probably not what the user intends and can cause
      crashes on 64-bit systems.

      The Doxygen documentation has been updated and passing values larger
      than UINT32_MAX for size_hint will now produce a normal HDF5 error.

        (DER - 2021/04/29, HDFFV-11241)


    - H5Pset_fapl_log() no longer crashes when passed an invalid fapl ID

      When passed an invalid fapl ID, H5Pset_fapl_log() would usually
      segfault when attempting to free an uninitialized pointer in the error
      handling code. This behavior is more common in release builds or
      when the memory sanitization checks were not selected as a build
      option.

      The pointer is now correctly initialized and the API call now
      produces a normal HDF5 error when fed an invalid fapl ID.

        (DER - 2021/04/28, HDFFV-11240)

    - Fixes a segfault when H5Pset_mdc_log_options() is called multiple times

      The call incorrectly attempts to free an internal copy of the previous
      log location string, which causes a segfault. This only happens
      when the call is invoked multiple times on the same property list.
      On the first call to a given fapl, the log location is set to NULL so
      the segfault does not occur.

      The string is now handled properly and the segfault no longer occurs.

        (DER - 2021/04/27, HDFFV-11239)


    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
    -


    Fortran Library:
    ----------------
    - H5Fget_name_f fixed to handle correctly trailing whitespaces and
      newly allocated buffers.

      (MSB - 2021/08/30, github-826,972)


    C++ Library:
    ------------
    -


    Java Library:
    -------------
    -


    Tools:
    ------
    - Refactored the perform tools and removed depends on test library.

        Moved the perf and h5perf tools from tools/test/perform to
        tools/src/h5perf so that they can be installed. This required
        that the test library dependency be removed by copying the
        needed functions from h5test.c.
        The standalone scripts and other perform tools remain in the
        tools/test/perform folder.

        (ADB - 2021/08/10)

    - Removed partial long exceptions

        Some of the tools accepted shortened versions of the long options
        (ex: --datas instead of --dataset). These were implemented inconsistently,
        are difficult to maintian, and occasionally block useful long option
        names. These partial long options have been removed from all the tools.

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.12.1 release
===================================
    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a segmentation fault

      A segmentation fault occurred with a Mathworks corrupted file.

      A detection of accessing a null pointer was added to prevent the problem.

      (BMR - 2021/10/14, HDFFV-11150)

    - Detection of simple data transform function "x"

        In the case of the simple data transform function "x" the (parallel)
        library recognizes this is the same as not applying this data transform
        function. This improves the I/O performance. In the case of the parallel
        library, it also avoids breaking to independent I/O, which makes it
        possible to apply a filter when writing or reading data to or from
        teh HDF5 file.

        (JWSB - 2021/09/13)

    - Fixed an invalid read and memory leak when parsing corrupt file space
      info messages

        When the corrupt file from CVE-2020-10810 was parsed by the library,
        the code that imports the version 0 file space info object header
        message to the version 1 struct could read past the buffer read from
        the disk, causing an invalid memory read. Not catching this error would
        cause downstream errors that eventually resulted in a previously
        allocated buffer to be unfreed when the library shut down. In builds
        where the free lists are in use, this could result in an infinite loop
        and SIGABRT when the library shuts down.

        We now track the buffer size and raise an error on attempts to read
        past the end of it.

        (DER - 2021/08/12, HDFFV-11053)

    Java Library
    ------------
    -


    Configuration
    -------------
    - Corrected path searched by CMake find_package command

      The install path for cmake find_package files had been changed to use
        "share/cmake"
      for all platforms. However the trailing "hdf5" directory was not removed.
      This "hdf5" additional directory has been removed.

      (ADB - 2021/09/27)

    - Corrected pkg-config compile script

      It was discovered that the position of the "$@" argument for the command
      in the compile script may fail on some platforms and configurations. The
      position of the "$@"command argument was moved before the pkg-config sub command.

      (ADB - 2021/08/30)

    - Fixed CMake C++ compiler flags

      A recent refactoring of the C++ configure files accidently removed the
      file that executed the enable_language command for C++ needed by the
      HDFCXXCompilerFlags.cmake file. Also updated the intel warnings files,
      including adding support for windows platforms.

      (ADB - 2021/08/10)

    - Better support for libaec (open-source Szip library) in CMake

      Implemented better support for libaec 1.0.5 (or later) library. This version
      of libaec contains improvements for better integration with HDF5. Furthermore,
      the variable USE_LIBAEC_STATIC has been introduced to allow to make use of
      static version of libaec library. Use libaec_DIR or libaec_ROOT to set
      the location in which libaec can be found.

      Be aware, the Szip library of libaec 1.0.4 depends on another library within
      libaec library. This dependency is not specified in the current CMake
      configuration which means that one can not use the static Szip library of
      libaec 1.0.4 when building HDF5. This has been resolved in libaec 1.0.5.

      (JWSB - 2021/06/22)


    Fortran API
    -----------
    -


    High-Level Library
    ------------------
    - Fixed HL_test_packet, test for packet table vlen of vlen.

      Incorrect length assignment.

        (ADB - 2021/10/14)


    Fortran High-Level APIs
    -----------------------
    -


    Documentation
    -------------
    -


    F90 APIs
    --------
    -


    C++ APIs
    --------
    - Added DataSet::operator=

        Some compilers complain if the copy constructor is given explicitly
        but the assignment operator is implicitly set to default.

Known Problems
==============

    testflushrefresh.sh will fail when run with "make check-passthrough-vol"
    on centos7, with 3 Errors/Segmentation faults.  These will not occur when
    run with "make check".  See https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues/673
    for details.

    The t_bigio test fails on several HPC platforms, generally by timeout with
    OpenMPI 4.0.0 or with this error from spectrum-mpi:
        *** on communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
        *** MPI_ERR_COUNT: invalid count argument

    CMake files do not behave correctly with paths containing spaces.
    Do not use spaces in paths because the required escaping for handling spaces
    results in very complex and fragile build files.
    ADB - 2019/05/07

    At present, metadata cache images may not be generated by parallel
    applications.  Parallel applications can read files with metadata cache
    images, but since this is a collective operation, a deadlock is possible
    if one or more processes do not participate.

    CPP ptable test fails on both VS2017 and VS2019 with Intel compiler, JIRA
    issue: HDFFV-10628.  This test will pass with VS2015 with Intel compiler.

    The subsetting option in ph5diff currently will fail and should be avoided.
    The subsetting option works correctly in serial h5diff.

    Known problems in previous releases can be found in the HISTORY*.txt files
    in the HDF5 source. Please report any new problems found to
    help@hdfgroup.org.


CMake vs. Autotools installations
=================================
While both build systems produce similar results, there are differences.
Each system produces the same set of folders on linux (only CMake works
on standard Windows); bin, include, lib and share. Autotools places the
COPYING and RELEASE.txt file in the root folder, CMake places them in
the share folder.

The bin folder contains the tools and the build scripts. Additionally, CMake
creates dynamic versions of the tools with the suffix "-shared". Autotools
installs one set of tools depending on the "--enable-shared" configuration
option.
  build scripts
  -------------
  Autotools: h5c++, h5cc, h5fc
  CMake: h5c++, h5cc, h5hlc++, h5hlcc

The include folder holds the header files and the fortran mod files. CMake
places the fortran mod files into separate shared and static subfolders,
while Autotools places one set of mod files into the include folder. Because
CMake produces a tools library, the header files for tools will appear in
the include folder.

The lib folder contains the library files, and CMake adds the pkgconfig
subfolder with the hdf5*.pc files used by the bin/build scripts created by
the CMake build. CMake separates the C interface code from the fortran code by
creating C-stub libraries for each Fortran library. In addition, only CMake
installs the tools library. The names of the szip libraries are different
between the build systems.

The share folder will have the most differences because CMake builds include
a number of CMake specific files for support of CMake's find_package and support
for the HDF5 Examples CMake project.

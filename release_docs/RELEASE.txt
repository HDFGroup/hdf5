New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    - Incorporated HDF5 examples repository into HDF5 library.

      The HDF5Examples folder is equivalent to the repository hdf5-examples.
      As such it can build and test the examples during library build or after
      the library is installed. Previously, the hdf5-repository archives were
      downloaded for packaging with the library. Now the examples can be built
      and tested without a packaged install of the library.

      However to maintain the ability to use the HDF5Examples with an installed
      library, it is necessary to translate or synch the option names from those
      used by the library to those used by the examples. The typical pattern is:
            <example option> = <library option>
            HDF_BUILD_FORTRAN = ${HDF5_BUILD_FORTRAN}

    - Added new option for CMake to mark tests as SKIPPED.

      HDF5_DISABLE_TESTS_REGEX is a REGEX string that will be checked with
      test names and if there is a match then that test's property will be
      set to DISABLED. HDF5_DISABLE_TESTS_REGEX can be initialized on the
      command line: "-DHDF5_DISABLE_TESTS_REGEX:STRING=<regex>"
      See CMake documentation for regex-specification.

    - Added defaults to CMake for long double conversion checks

      HDF5 performs a couple of checks at build time to see if long double
      values can be converted correctly (IBM's Power architecture uses a
      special format for long doubles). These checks were performed using
      TRY_RUN, which is a problem when cross-compiling.

      These checks now use default values appropriate for most non-Power
      systems when cross-compiling. The cache values can be pre-set if
      necessary, which will preempt both the TRY_RUN and the default.

      Affected values:
        H5_LDOUBLE_TO_LONG_SPECIAL      (default no)
        H5_LONG_TO_LDOUBLE_SPECIAL      (default no)
        H5_LDOUBLE_TO_LLONG_ACCURATE    (default yes)
        H5_LLONG_TO_LDOUBLE_CORRECT     (default yes)
        H5_DISABLE_SOME_LDOUBLE_CONV    (default no)

      Fixes GitHub #3585

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.14.3 release
===================================
    Library
    -------
    - Memory usage growth issue

      Starting with the HDF5 1.12.1 release, an issue (GitHub issue #1256)
      was observed where running a simple program that has a loop of opening
      a file, reading from an object with a variable-length datatype and
      then closing the file would result in the process fairly quickly
      running out of memory. Upon further investigation, it was determined
      that this memory was being kept around in the library's datatype
      conversion pathway cache that is used to speed up datatype conversions
      which are repeatedly used within an HDF5 application's lifecycle. For
      conversions involving variable-length or reference datatypes, each of
      these cached pathway entries keeps a reference to its associated file
      for later use. Since the file was being closed and reopened on each
      loop iteration, and since the library compares for equality between
      instances of opened files (rather than equality of the actual files)
      when determining if it can reuse a cached conversion pathway, it was
      determining that no cached conversion pathways could be reused and was
      creating a new cache entry on each loop iteration during I/O. This
      would lead to constant growth of that cache and the memory it consumed,
      as well as constant growth of the memory consumed by each cached entry
      for the reference to its associated file.

      To fix this issue, the library now removes any cached datatype
      conversion path entries for variable-length or reference datatypes
      associated with a particular file when that file is closed.

      Fixes GitHub #1256

    - Suppressed floating-point exceptions in H5T init code

      The floating-point datatype initialization code in H5Tinit_float.c
      could raise FE_INVALID exceptions while munging bits and performing
      comparisons that might involve NaN. This was not a problem when the
      initialization code was executed in H5detect at compile time (prior
      to 1.14.3), but now that the code is executed at library startup
      (1.14.3+), these exceptions can be caught by user code, as is the
      default in the NAG Fortran compiler.

      Starting in 1.14.4, we now suppress floating-point exceptions while
      initializing the floating-point types and clear FE_INVALID before
      restoring the original environment.

      Fixes GitHub #3831

    - Fixed a file handle leak in the core VFD

      When opening a file with the core VFD and a file image, if the file
      already exists, the file check would leak the POSIX file handle.

      Fixes GitHub issue #635

    - Dropped support for MPI-2

      The MPI-2 supporting artifacts have been removed due to the cessation
      of MPI-2 maintenance and testing since version HDF5 1.12.


    Java Library
    ------------

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Changed default of 'Error on HDF5 doxygen warnings' DOXYGEN_WARN_AS_ERROR option.

      The default setting of DOXYGEN_WARN_AS_ERROR to 'FAIL_ON_WARNINGS' has been changed
      to 'NO'. It was decided that the setting was too aggressive and should be a user choice.
      The github actions and scripts have been updated to reflect this.

        * HDF5_ENABLE_DOXY_WARNINGS: ON/OFF (Default: OFF)
        * --enable-doxygen-errors: enable/disable (Default: disable)

    - Removed an Autotools configure hack that causes problems on MacOS

      A sed line in configure.ac was added in the past to paper over some
      problems with older versions of the Autotools that would add incorrect
      linker flags. This hack is not needed with recent versions of the
      Autotools and the sed line errors on MacOS (though this was a silent
      error that didn't break the build) so the hack has been removed.

      Fixes GitHub issue #3843

    - Fixed an issue where the h5tools_test_utils test program was being
      installed on the system for Autotools builds of HDF5

      The h5tools_test_utils test program was mistakenly added to bin_PROGRAMS
      in its Makefile.am configuration file, causing the executable to be
      installed on the system. The executable is now added to noinst_PROGRAMS
      instead and will no longer be installed on the system for Autotools builds
      of HDF5. The CMake configuration code already avoids installing the
      executable on the system.

Known Problems
==============

    When HDF5 is compiled with NVHPC versions 23.5 - 23.9 (additional versions may
    also be applicable) and with -O2 (or higher) and -DNDEBUG, test failures occur
    in the following tests:

        H5PLUGIN-filter_plugin
        H5TEST-flush2
        H5TEST-testhdf5-base
        MPI_TEST_t_filters_parallel

    Since these tests pass with an optimization level of -O1 (and -O0) and it is
    currently unclear whether the test failures are due to issues in HDF5 or issues
    in the 'nvc' compiler, the maximum optimization level for NVHPC has been set
    to -O1 until the test failures can be resolved. Note that even at -O1 optimization
    level, there still appears to be a sporadic test failure in the Java JUnit tests
    that has occasionally been seen in JUnit-TestH5Pfapl and JUnit-TestH5D. It is also
    unclear whether this is an issue in HDF5 or with the 'nvc' compiler. Finally, note
    that NVHPC 23.9 will fail to compile the test/tselect.c test file with a compiler
    error of 'use of undefined value' when the optimization level is -O2 or higher.
    Nvidia is aware of this issue and has suggested lowering the optimization level to
    -O1 for the time being:

    CMake files do not behave correctly with paths containing spaces.
    Do not use spaces in paths because the required escaping for handling spaces
    results in very complex and fragile build files.

    At present, metadata cache images may not be generated by parallel
    applications.  Parallel applications can read files with metadata cache
    images, but since this is a collective operation, a deadlock is possible
    if one or more processes do not participate.

    CPP ptable test fails on both VS2017 and VS2019 with Intel compiler, JIRA
    issue: HDFFV-10628.  This test will pass with VS2015 with Intel compiler.

    The subsetting option in ph5diff currently will fail and should be avoided.
    The subsetting option works correctly in serial h5diff.

    Several tests currently fail on certain platforms:
        MPI_TEST-t_bigio fails with spectrum-mpi on ppc64le platforms.

        MPI_TEST-t_subfiling_vfd and MPI_TEST_EXAMPLES-ph5_subfiling fail with
        cray-mpich on theta and with XL compilers on ppc64le platforms.

        MPI_TEST_testphdf5_tldsc fails with cray-mpich 7.7 on cori and theta.

    Known problems in previous releases can be found in the HISTORY*.txt files
    in the HDF5 source. Please report any new problems found to
    help@hdfgroup.org.


CMake vs. Autotools installations
=================================
While both build systems produce similar results, there are differences.
Each system produces the same set of folders on linux (only CMake works
on standard Windows); bin, include, lib and share. Autotools places the
COPYING and RELEASE.txt file in the root folder, CMake places them in
the share folder.

The bin folder contains the tools and the build scripts. Additionally, CMake
creates dynamic versions of the tools with the suffix "-shared". Autotools
installs one set of tools depending on the "--enable-shared" configuration
option.
  build scripts
  -------------
  Autotools: h5c++, h5cc, h5fc
  CMake: h5c++, h5cc, h5hlc++, h5hlcc

The include folder holds the header files and the fortran mod files. CMake
places the fortran mod files into separate shared and static subfolders,
while Autotools places one set of mod files into the include folder. Because
CMake produces a tools library, the header files for tools will appear in
the include folder.

The lib folder contains the library files, and CMake adds the pkgconfig
subfolder with the hdf5*.pc files used by the bin/build scripts created by
the CMake build. CMake separates the C interface code from the fortran code by
creating C-stub libraries for each Fortran library. In addition, only CMake
installs the tools library. The names of the szip libraries are different
between the build systems.

The share folder will have the most differences because CMake builds include
a number of CMake specific files for support of CMake's find_package and support
for the HDF5 Examples CMake project.

The issues with the gif tool are:
    HDFFV-10592 CVE-2018-17433
    HDFFV-10593 CVE-2018-17436
    HDFFV-11048 CVE-2020-10809
These CVE issues have not yet been addressed and are avoided by not building
the gif tool by default. Enable building the High-Level tools with these options:
    autotools:   --enable-hlgiftools
    cmake:       HDF5_BUILD_HL_GIF_TOOLS=ON

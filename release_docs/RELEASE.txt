New Features
============

    Configuration:
    --------------

    Library:
    --------
        - Added new fields to the H5G_stat_t for more information about an
            object's object header.  QAK 2003/10/06
        - Added new H5Fget_freespace() routine to query the free space in a
            given file.  QAK 2003/10/06

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------

    Tools:
    ------

    C++ API:
    --------
        - Added overloaded functions read and write to H5::Attribute.
          BMR - 2003/04/21
        - Added an overloaded constructor H5::StrType so the need to separately
          set the length of the string type can be eliminated. BMR - 2003/04/21
        - Added overloaded functions read and write to H5::DataSet.
          BMR - 2003/04/27

        The following items were added but not documented in previous releases:

        - On windows, any application, that uses the C++ API dll, must
          include the name HDF5CPP_USEDLL in its project setting. (Feb 17, 2002)
          BMR - 2003/10/10
        - Added missing default constructor H5::H5File. (Apr 26, 2002)
          BMR - 2003/10/10
        - Added new member function H5::DataSet::fillMemBuf per the new C
          API H5Dfill, which fills the elements in a selection for a memory
          buffer with a fill value. (May 16, 2002) BMR - 2003/10/10
        - Added the new member function getMemberIndex to H5::EnumType
          and H5::CompType to match the new C API H5Tget_member_index.  Given
          the name of a member of an enumeration or compound datatype, this
          new function queries the index of the member. (May 16, 2002)
          BMR - 2003/10/10
        - Added these member functions to H5::Group per the new C functions
          H5Gget_num_objs, H5Gget_objname_by_idx and H5Gget_objtype_by_idx:
          + getNumObjs: Returns the number of objects in the group.
          + getObjnameByIdx: Retrieves the name of an object in a group,
                             given an index
          + getObjTypeByIdx: Returns the type of an object in a group,
                             given an index
          (Jan 20, 2003) BMR - 2003/10/10

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.0 release
==================================

    Library
    -------
        - Fixed incorrect datatype of the third parameter to the Fortran90
          h5pget_cache_f function (INTEGER(SIZE_T) to INTEGER) EIP - 2003/10/10
        - Fixed problems with accessing variable-length data datatypes on
            Crays.  QAK - 2003/10/10
        - Fixed potential file corruption bug when too many object header
            messages (probably attributes, from a user perspective) were
            inserted into an object header and certain other conditions were
            met.  QAK - 2003/10/08
        - Changed implementation of internal ID searching algorithm to avoid
            O(n) behavior for many common cases.  QAK - 2003/10/06
        - Allow partial parallel writing to compact datasets.  QAK - 2003/10/06
        - Correctly create reference to shared datatype in attribute, instead
            of making a copy of the shared datatype in the attribute.
            QAK - 2003/10/01
        - Revert changes which caused files >2GB to fail when created with
            MPI-I/O file driver on certain platforms.  QAK - 2003/09/16
        - Allow compound datatypes to grow in size.  SLU - 2003/09/10
        - Detect if a type is already packed before attempting to pack it
            again or check if it is locked.  SLU - 2003/09/10
        - Corrected bug when opening a file twice with read-only permission
            for one open and then closing the read-only access file ID would
            generate an error.  QAK - 2003/09/10
        - Corrected bug in repeated calls to H5Pget_access_plist() which would
            incorrectly manage reference counts of internal information and
            eventually blow up.  QAK - 2003/09/02
        - Return rank of the array datatype on successful call to
            H5Tget_array_dims().  QAK - 2003/08/30
        - Corrected bug in H5Tdetect_class which was not correctly detecting
            datatype classes of fields in nested compound datatypes in some
            circumstances.  QAK - 2003/08/30
        - Corrected bug in sieve buffer code which could cause loss of data
            when a small dataset was created and deleted in quick succession.
            QAK - 2003/08/27
        - Corrected bug in H5Gget_objname_by_idx which was not allowing NULL
            for the name when just querying for the object name's length.
            QAK - 2003/08/25
        - Corrected bug in variable-length string handling which could
            generate a core dump on writing variable-length strings as part
            of a compound datatype on certain architectures.  QAK - 2003/08/25
        - Corrected bug in H5Tget_native_type which would incorrectly compute
            the size of certain compound datatypes and also incorrectly
            compute the offset of the last field for those compound datatypes.
            QAK - 2003/08/25
        - Corrected bug in H5Tget_native_type which would drop string datatype
            metadata (padding, etc.)  QAK - 2003/08/25
        - Corrected bugs in H5Gget_num_objs, H5Gget_objname_by_idx and
            H5Gget_objtype_by_idx to allow them to accept location IDs, not just
            group IDs.  QAK - 2003/08/21
        - Corrected bug when using scalar dataspace for memory selection and
            operating on chunked dataset.  QAK - 2003/08/18
        - Corrected bugs with multiple '/' characters in names for H5Glink
            and H5Gunlink.  QAK - 2003/08/16
        - Corrected bug with user blocks that didn't allow a user block to
            be inserted in front of a file after the file was created.
            QAK - 2003/08/13
        - Corrected errors with using point selections to access data in
            chunked datasets.  QAK - 2003/07/23
        - Corrected error with variable-length datatypes and chunked datasets
            which caused H5Dwrite to fail sometimes.  QAK - 2003/07/19
        - Modified library and file format to support storing indexed storage
            (chunked dataset) B-tree's with non-default internal 'K' values.
            QAK - 2003/07/15
        - Returned H5T_BKG_TEMP support to library after it was accidentally
            removed.  QAK - 2003/07/14

    Configuration
    -------------
        - Fixed the error that caused "make install" to fail because of the
            macro definition syntax of "prefix?=..."  AKC - 2003/07/22

    Performance
    -------------

    Tools
    -----
	- Fixed a segmentation fault of h5diff when percentage option is used.
            AKC - 2003/08/27
        - Switched away from tools using internal "fixtype" function(s) to use
            H5Tget_native_type() internally.  QAK - 2003/08/25

Known Problems
==============

* PGI C++ compiler fails when compiling the C++ library's tests.
  Therefore, we cannot verify that the C++ library built with the PGI C++
  compiler is correct.

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF 5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
  compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
  able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

        warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
  This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.


* The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows. It is not supported
  in the TFLOPS machine.


* The ./dsets tests failed in the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The hdf5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
    - Cray J90 and Cray T90IEEE give errors during testing when displaying
      some floating-point values. These are benign differences due to
      the different precision in the values displayed and h5ls appears to
      be dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

* Before building HDF5 F90 Library from source on Crays 
  replace H5Aff.f90, H5Dff.f90 and H5Pff.f90 files in the fortran/src
  subdirectory in the top level directory with the Cray-specific files
  from the site:

* On some platforms that use Intel compilers to build HDF5 fortran library,
  compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 and fflush2.f90
  complaining about exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error)

  ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/pub/outgoing/hdf5/hdf5-1.6.0/F90_source_for_Crays

* On IA32 and IA64 systems, if you use a compiler other than GCC (such as
  Intel's ecc or icc compilers), you will need to modify the generated
  "libtool" program after configuration is finished. On or around line 104 of
  the libtool file, there are lines which look like:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl=""

  change these lines to this:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl="-Wl,"

  UPDATE: This is now done automatically by the configure script. However, if
  you still experience a problem, you may want to check this line in the
  libtool file and make sure that it has the correct value.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8

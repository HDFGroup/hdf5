New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    - Dropped support for the traditional MSVC preprocessor

      Visual Studio has recently started using a standards-compliant
      preprocessor (In VS2019+) and this is the default in C11.

      https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/preprocessor-experimental-overview?view=msvc-170

      Because of this, we've dropped support for the traditional
      MSVC preprocessor.

    - The standard for building the library is now C11

      We have updated the build files to set the C standard to C11, though
      some platforms use gnu11 to get some GNU things to work.

    - Added configuration option for internal threading/concurrency support:

          CMake:      HDF5_ENABLE_THREADS (ON/OFF) (Default: ON)
          Autotools:  --enable-threads    (yes/no) (Default: yes)

      This option enables support for threading and concurrency algorithms
      within the HDF5 library.  It is required for, but separate from, the
      'threadsafe' configure option, which makes the HDF5 API safe to call from
      multiple threads.  It is possible to enable the 'threads' option and
      disable the 'threadsafe' option, but not vice versa.  The 'threads' option
      must be on to enable the subfiling VFD.


    Library:
    --------
    - H5Pset_external() now uses HDoff_t, which is always a 64-bit type

      The H5Pset_external() call took an off_t parameter in HDF5 1.14.x and
      earlier. On POSIX systems, off_t is specified as a 64-bit type via
      POSIX large-file support (LFS). On Windows, however, off_t is defined
      as a 32-bit type, even on 64-bit Windows.

      HDoff_t has been added to H5public.h and is defined to be int64_t on
      Windows and the library has been updated to use HDoff_t in place of
      off_t throughout. The H5Pset_external() offset parameter has also been
      updated to be HDoff_t.

      There is no API compatibility wrapper for this change.

      Fixes GitHub issue #3506

    Tools:
    ------
    - Remove the high-level GIF tools

      The high-level GIF tools, h52gif and gif2h5, have unfixed CVE issues
      (with no proof-of-concept files). They are not critical tools, are not
      well maintained, and are an odd fit for building with the library.
      Because of this, they have been removed. We may move them to a separate
      repository in the future.

      This also removes the following configure options:

        Autotools:  --(dis|en)able-hlgiftools

        CMake:      HDF5_BUILD_HL_GIF_TOOLS

    - The COPYING file has been renamed to LICENSE

      This is where most people will expect to find license information. The
      COPYING_LBNL_HDF5 file has also been renamed to LICENSE_LBNL_HDF5.
      The licenses are unchanged.

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.16.0 release
===================================
    Library
    -------
    - Only clear FE_INVALID when that symbol is present on the system

      When we initialize the floating-point types at library startup, it's
      possible to raise floating-point exceptions when we check which things
      are supported. Normally, we clear these floating-point exceptions via
      feclearexcept(FE_INVALID), but FE_INVALID may not be present on all
      systems. Specifically, this was reported as being a problem when using
      Emscripten 3.1.68 to compile HDF5 1.14.5 to WebAssembly.

      We've added an #ifdef FE_INVALID block around the exception clearing
      code to correct this.

      Fixes GitHub issue #4952


    Java Library
    ------------
    -


    Configuration
    -------------
    - Changed name of libhdf5hl_fortran installed by autotools to libhdf5_hl_fortran.  The 
      new name is consistent with the name of the lib when installed by CMake and with the 
      other hl libs.  

      Fixes GitHub issue #4811

Platforms Tested
===================

    - HDF5 is tested with the two latest macOS versions that are available
      on github runners. As new major macOS versions become available, HDF5
      will discontinue support for the older version and add the new latest
      version to its list of compatible systems, along with the previous
      version.

Known Problems
==============

 -  When building with the NAG Fortran compiler using the Autotools and libtool
    2.4.2 or earlier, the -shared flag will be missing '-Wl,', which will cause
    compilation to fail. This is due to a bug in libtool that was fixed in 2012
    and released in 2.4.4 in 2014.

 -  When the library detects and builds in support for the _Float16 datatype, an
    issue has been observed on at least one MacOS 14 system where the library
    fails to initialize due to not being able to detect the byte order of the
    _Float16 type (https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues/4310):

        #5: H5Tinit_float.c line 308 in H5T__fix_order(): failed to detect byte order
        major: Datatype
        minor: Unable to initialize object

    If this issue is encountered, support for the _Float16 type can be disabled
    with a configuration option:

        CMake:      HDF5_ENABLE_NONSTANDARD_FEATURE_FLOAT16=OFF
        Autotools:  --disable-nonstandard-feature-float16

 -  When HDF5 is compiled with NVHPC versions 23.5 - 23.9 (additional versions may
    also be applicable) and with -O2 (or higher) and -DNDEBUG, test failures occur
    in the following tests:

        H5PLUGIN-filter_plugin
        H5TEST-flush2
        H5TEST-testhdf5-base
        MPI_TEST_t_filters_parallel

    Sporadic failures (even with lower -O levels):
        Java JUnit-TestH5Pfapl
        Java JUnit-TestH5D

    Also, NVHPC will fail to compile the test/tselect.c test file with a compiler
    error of 'use of undefined value' when the optimization level is -O2 or higher.

    This is confirmed to be a bug in the nvc compiler that has been fixed as of
    23.11. If you are using an affected version of the NVidia compiler, the
    work-around is to set the optimization level to -O1.

 -  CMake files do not behave correctly with paths containing spaces.
    Do not use spaces in paths because the required escaping for handling spaces
    results in very complex and fragile build files.

 -  At present, metadata cache images may not be generated by parallel
    applications.  Parallel applications can read files with metadata cache
    images, but since this is a collective operation, a deadlock is possible
    if one or more processes do not participate.

 -  The subsetting option in ph5diff currently will fail and should be avoided.
    The subsetting option works correctly in serial h5diff.

 -  Flang Fortran compilation will fail (last check version 17) due to not yet
    implemented: (1) derived type argument passed by value (H5VLff.F90),
    and (2) support for REAL with KIND = 2 in intrinsic SPACING used in testing.

 -  Fortran tests HDF5_1_8.F90 and HDF5_F03.F90 will fail with Cray compilers
    greater than version 16.0 due to a compiler bug. The latest version verified
    as failing was version 17.0.

 -  Several tests currently fail on certain platforms:
        MPI_TEST-t_bigio fails with spectrum-mpi on ppc64le platforms.

        MPI_TEST-t_subfiling_vfd and MPI_TEST_EXAMPLES-ph5_subfiling fail with
        cray-mpich on theta and with XL compilers on ppc64le platforms.

        MPI_TEST_testphdf5_tldsc fails with cray-mpich 7.7 on cori and theta.

 -  File space may not be released when overwriting or deleting certain nested
    variable length or reference types.

 -  Known problems in previous releases can be found in the HISTORY*.txt files
    in the HDF5 source. Please report any new problems found to
    help@hdfgroup.org.


CMake vs. Autotools installations
=================================
While both build systems produce similar results, there are differences.
Each system produces the same set of folders on Linux (only CMake works
on standard Windows); bin, include, lib and share. Autotools places the
LICENSE and RELEASE.txt file in the root folder, CMake places them in
the share folder.

The bin folder contains the tools and the build scripts. Additionally, CMake
creates dynamic versions of the tools with the suffix "-shared". Autotools
installs one set of tools depending on the "--enable-shared" configuration
option.
  build scripts
  -------------
  Autotools: h5c++, h5cc, h5fc
  CMake: h5c++, h5cc, h5hlc++, h5hlcc

The include folder holds the header files and the fortran mod files. CMake
places the fortran mod files into separate shared and static subfolders,
while Autotools places one set of mod files into the include folder. Because
CMake produces a tools library, the header files for tools will appear in
the include folder.

The lib folder contains the library files, and CMake adds the pkgconfig
subfolder with the hdf5*.pc files used by the bin/build scripts created by
the CMake build. CMake separates the C interface code from the fortran code by
creating C-stub libraries for each Fortran library. In addition, only CMake
installs the tools library. The names of the szip libraries are different
between the build systems.

The share folder will have the most differences because CMake builds include
a number of CMake specific files for support of CMake's find_package and support
for the HDF5 Examples CMake project.

The issues with the gif tool are:
    HDFFV-10592 CVE-2018-17433
    HDFFV-10593 CVE-2018-17436
    HDFFV-11048 CVE-2020-10809
These CVE issues have not yet been addressed and are avoided by not building
the gif tool by default. Enable building the High-Level tools with these options:
    autotools:   --enable-hlgiftools
    cmake:       HDF5_BUILD_HL_GIF_TOOLS=ON

New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    - Thread-safety + static library disabled on Windows w/ CMake

      The thread-safety feature requires hooks in DllMain(), which is only
      present in the shared library.

      We previously just warned about this, but now any CMake configuration
      that tries to build thread-safety and the static library will fail.
      This cannot be overridden with ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED.

      Fixes GitHub issue #3613

    - Bumped the minimum required version of Autoconf to 2.71.

      This fixes a problem with the Intel oneAPI Fortran compiler's -loopopt
      option being interpreted as a linker option (see bug fixes, below).

      This should only affect building the library from a maintenance branch
      using Autotools, when autogen.sh is used to generate the Autotools
      files.

      It does NOT affect the binaries or building from the source tarballs
      that we distribute at release as Autoconf does not need to be re-run.

    - Added support for CMake presets file.

      CMake supports two main files, CMakePresets.json and CMakeUserPresets.json,
      that allow users to specify common configure options and share them with others.
      This release added a CMakePresets.json file of a typical configuration and support
      file, config/cmake-presets/hidden-presets.json. It also added a section to 
      INSTALL_CMake.txt with very basic explanation of the process to use CMakePresets.

    - Enabled instrumentation of the library by default in CMake for parallel
      debug builds.

      HDF5 can be configured to instrument portions of the parallel library to
      aid in debugging. Autotools builds of HDF5 turn this capability on by
      default for parallel debug builds and off by default for other build types.
      CMake has been updated to match this behavior.

    - Added new option to build libaec and zlib inline with CMake.

      Using the CMake FetchContent module, the external filters can populate
      content at configure time via any method supported by the ExternalProject
      module. Whereas ExternalProject_Add() downloads at build time, the
      FetchContent module makes content available immediately, allowing the
      configure step to use the content in commands like add_subdirectory(),
      include() or file() operations.

      The HDF options (and defaults) for using this are:
          BUILD_SZIP_WITH_FETCHCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
          LIBAEC_USE_LOCALCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
          BUILD_ZLIB_WITH_FETCHCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
          ZLIB_USE_LOCALCONTENT:BOOL=OFF

      The CMake variables to control the path and file names:
          LIBAEC_TGZ_ORIGPATH:STRING
          LIBAEC_TGZ_ORIGNAME:STRING
          ZLIB_TGZ_ORIGPATH:STRING
          ZLIB_TGZ_ORIGNAME:STRING

      See the CMakeFilters.cmake and config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake files for usage.

    - Added new CMake configuration variable HDF5_USE_GNU_DIRS.

      HDF5_USE_GNU_DIRS (default OFF) selects the use of GNU Coding Standard install
      directory variables by including the CMake module, GNUInstallDirs (see CMake
      documentation for details). The HDF_DIR_PATHS macro in the HDFMacros.cmake file
      sets various PATH variables for use during the build, test, and install processes.
      By default, the historical settings for these variables will be used.

    - Corrected the usage of CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY and where to
      install Fortran mod files.

      The Fortran modules files, ending in .mod are files describing a
      Fortran 90 (and above) module API and ABI. These are not like C
      header files describing an API, they are compiler dependent and
      architecture dependent, and not easily readable by a human being. They are
      nevertheless searched for in the includes directories by gfortran
      (in directories specified with -I).
 
      Autotools configure uses the -fmoddir option to specify the folder.
      CMake will use "mod" folder by default unless overridden by the CMake
      variable HDF5_INSTALL_MODULE_DIR.


    Library:
    --------
    - Changed the error handling for a not found path in the find plugin process.

      While attempting to load a plugin, the HDF5 library will fail if one of the
      directories in the plugin paths does not exist, even if there are more paths
      to check. Instead of exiting the function with an error, it now just logs the error
      and continues processing the list of paths to check.


    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
    -


    Fortran Library:
    ----------------
    - Removed "-commons" linking option on Darwin, as COMMON and EQUIVALENCE
      are no longer used in the Fortran source.

      Fixes GitHub issue #3571


    C++ Library:
    ------------
    -


    Java Library:
    -------------
    - Fixed memory leaks that can occur when reading a dataset from a
      malformed file.

      When attempting to read layout, pline, and efl information for a
      dataset, memory leaks could occur if attempting to read pline/efl
      information throws an error. The leaks would occur because the memory 
      that was allocated for pline and efl not being properly cleaned up by
      error handling. 
	
      Fixes Github issue #2602

    - Deprecated the HDF5GroupInfo class.

      This class assumes that an object can contain four values which uniquely identify an
      object among those HDF5 files which are open. This is no longer valid in future
      HDF5 releases.

    - Added version of H5Rget_name to return the name as a Java string.

      Other functions that use the "get_name" process use "get_size" before 
      retrieving the name. This happens in the JNI wrapper implementation of 
      the function. Now H5Rget_name has a H5Rget_name_string which returns the 
      string like similar functions.

    - Added reference support to H5A and H5D read write vlen JNI functions.

      This release implemented a change to handle VL references as an Array of Lists
      of byte arrays.

      The JNI wrappers translate the Array of Lists to/from the hvl_t vlen
      structures. The wrappers use the specified datatype arguments for the
      List type translation; it is expected that the Java type is correct.

      Fixes Jira issue HDFFV-11318

    - Corrected H5A and H5D read write vlen JNI functions.

      The VLStrings functions now correctly use the implementation previously used
      by the VL functions. (VLStrings functions did not have an implementation.)
      The new VL functions implementation now expect an Array of Lists between
      Java and the JNI wrapper. 

      The JNI wrappers translate the Array of Lists to/from the hvl_t vlen
      structures. The wrappers use the specified datatype arguments for the
      List type translation, it is expected that the Java type is correct.

      Fixes Jira issue HDFFV-11310

    - Corrected H5A and H5D read write JNI functions with a flawed vlen datatype check.

      Adapted tools function for JNI utils file. This reduces multiple calls
      to a single check and variable. The variable can then be used to call 
      the H5Treclaim function. This release also adjusts the existing test and adds 
      a new test.


    Tools:
    ------
    - Fixed an issue with h5dump not properly displaying 1.10 References in containers.

      Ported 1.10 tools display function to provide ability to inspect and
      display 1.10 reference data. 


    High-Level APIs:
    ----------------

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.12.2 release
===================================
    Library
    -------
    - Fixed memory leak during shut down.

      A malformed file could result in chunk index memory leaks. Under most
      conditions (i.e., when the --enable-using-memchecker option is NOT
      used), this would result in a small memory leak and and infinite loop
      and abort when shutting down the library. The infinite loop would be
      due to the "free list" package not being able to clear its resources
      so the library couldn't shut down. When the "using a memory checker"
      option is used, the free lists are disabled so there is just a memory
      leak with no abort on library shutdown.

      The chunk index resources are now correctly cleaned up when reading
      misparsed files and valgrind confirms no memory leaks.

      Fixes CVE-2018-11202 

    - Fixed an assertion in a previous fix for CVE-2016-4332.

      An assert could fail when processing corrupt files that have invalid
      shared message flags (as in CVE-2016-4332).

      The assert statement in question has been replaced with pointer checks
      that don't raise errors. Since the function is in cleanup code, we do
      our best to close and free things, even when presented with partially
      initialized structs.

      Fixes CVE-2016-4332 and HDFFV-9950 (confirmed via the cve_hdf5 repo)

    - Fixed a file space allocation bug in the parallel library for chunked
      datasets.

      With the addition of support for incremental file space allocation for
      chunked datasets with filters applied to them that are created/accessed
      in parallel, a bug was introduced to the library's parallel file space
      allocation code. This could cause file space to not be allocated correctly
      for datasets without filters applied to them that are created with serial
      file access and later opened with parallel file access. In turn, this could
      cause parallel writes to those datasets to place incorrect data in the file.

    - Fixed an assertion failure in Parallel HDF5 when a file can't be created
      due to an invalid library version bounds setting.

      An assertion failure could occur in H5MF_settle_raw_data_fsm when a file
      can't be created with Parallel HDF5 due to specifying the use of a paged,
      persistent file free space manager
      (H5Pset_file_space_strategy(..., H5F_FSPACE_STRATEGY_PAGE, 1, ...)) with
      an invalid library version bounds combination
      (H5Pset_libver_bounds(..., H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST, H5F_LIBVER_V18)). This
      has now been fixed.

    - Fixed a bug in H5Ocopy that could generate invalid HDF5 files.

      H5Ocopy was missing a check to determine whether the new object's
      object header version is greater than version 1. Without this check,
      copying of objects with object headers that are smaller than a
      certain size would cause H5Ocopy to create an object header for the
      new object that has a gap in the header data. According to the
      HDF5 File Format Specification, this is not allowed for version
      1 of the object header format.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2653

    - Fixed potential heap buffer overflow in decoding of link info message.

      Detections of buffer overflow were added for decoding version, index
      flags, link creation order value, and the next three addresses. The
      checkings will remove the potential invalid read of any of these
      values that could be triggered by a malformed file.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2603

    - Fixed potential buffer overrun issues in some object header decode routines.

      Several checks were added to H5O__layout_decode and H5O__sdspace_decode to
      ensure that memory buffers don't get overrun when decoding buffers read from
      a possibly corrupted HDF5 file.

    - Fixed a heap buffer overflow that occurs when reading from a dataset with
      a compact layout within a malformed HDF5 file.

      During opening of a dataset that has a compact layout, the library allocates 
      a buffer that stores the dataset's raw data. The dataset's object header that
      gets written to the file contains information about how large of a buffer the
      library should allocate. If this object header is malformed such that it causes
      the library to allocate a buffer that is too small to hold the dataset's raw data,
      future I/O to the dataset can result in heap buffer overflows. To fix this issue, 
      an extra check is now performed for compact datasets to ensure that the size of the 
      allocated buffer matches the expected size of the dataset's raw data (as calculated
      from the dataset's dataspace and datatype information). If the two sizes do not match, 
      opening of the dataset will fail.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2606

    - Fixed an issue with malformed HDF5 files causing heap overflow.

      Malformed HDF5 files may have truncated content which does not match the expected size. 
      When H5O__pline_decode() attempts to decode these it may read past the end of the 
      allocated space leading to heap overflows as bounds checking is incomplete.

      The fix ensures each element is within bounds before reading.

      Fixes Jira issue HDFFV-10712, CVE-2019-8396, GitHub issue #2209

    - Fixed memory leak when running h5dump with proof of vulnerability file.

      The fuzzed file "pov" was an HDF5 file containing an illegal continuation
      message. When deserializing the object header chunks for the file, memory
      was allocated for the array of continuation messages, but this memory was
      never freed when an error occurred.

      The allocated memory is now properly released.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2599

    - Fixed a memory corruption issue that can occur when reading from a dataset 
      using a hyperslab selection in the file dataspace and a point selection in
      the memory dataspace.

      When reading from a dataset using a hyperslab selection in the dataset's file
      dataspace and a point selection in the dataset's memory dataspace where the file
      dataspace's "rank" is greater than the memory dataspace's "rank", memory
      corruption could occur due to an incorrect number of selection points being copied
      when projecting the point selection onto the hyperslab selection's dataspace.

      Fixes CVE-2021-37501 and GHSA-rfgw-5vq3-wrjf

    - Added a check for overflow when calculating on-disk attribute data size.

      A bogus hdf5 file may contain dataspace messages with sizes
      which lead to the on-disk data sizes to exceed what is addressable.
      When calculating the size, this update now ensures that the 
      multiplication does not overflow. The test case was crafted in a way 
      that the overflow caused the size to be 0.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2458

    - Fixed seg fault on file close.

      h5debug fails at file close with core dump on a file that has an
      illegal file size in its cache image. In H5F_dest(), the library
      performs all the closing operations for the file and keeps track of
      the error encountered when reading the file cache image. At the end of 
      the routine, it frees the file's file structure and returns an error. 
      Due to the error return, the file object is not removed from the ID 
      node table. This eventually causes assertion failure in 
      H5VL__native_file_close() when the library finally exits and tries to 
      access that file object in the table for closing.

      The closing routine, H5F_dest(), will not free the file structure if
      there is an error, keeping a valid file structure in the ID node table.
      It will be freed later in H5VL__native_file_close() when the library 
      exits and terminates the file package.

      Fixes Jira issue HDFFV-11052, CVE-2020-10812

    - Fixed an issue with variable length attributes.

      Previously, if a variable length attribute was held open while its file
      was opened through another handle, the same attribute was opened through
      the second file handle, and the second file and attribute handles were
      closed, attempting to write to the attribute through the first handle
      would cause an error.

    - Fixed an issue with hyperslab selections.

      Previously, when combining hyperslab selections, it was possible for the
      library to produce an incorrect combined selection.

    - Fixed an issue with attribute type conversion with compound datatypes.

      Previously, when performing type conversion for attribute I/O with a
      compound datatype, the library would not fill the background buffer with
      the contents of the destination, potentially causing data to be lost when
      only writing to a subset of the compound fields.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2016

    - Modified H5Fstart_swmr_write() to preserve DAPL properties.

      Internally, H5Fstart_swmr_write() closes and reopens the file in question
      as part of its process for making the file SWMR-safe. Previously, when
      the library reopened the file it would simply use the default access
      properties. This release modifies the library to instead save these 
      properties and use them when reopening the file.

      Fixes Jira issue HDFFV-11308

    - Converted an assertion on (possibly corrupt) file contents to a normal
      error check.

      Previously, the library contained an assertion check that a read superblock
      doesn't contain a superblock extension message when the superblock
      version < 2. When a corrupt HDF5 file is read, this assertion can be triggered
      in debug builds of HDF5. In production builds, this situation could cause
      either a library error or a crash, depending on the platform.

      Fixes Jira issues HDFFV-11316 & HDFFV-11317

    - Fixed memory leak with variable-length fill values.
    
      A memory leak was observed with variable-length fill value in 
      H5O_fill_convert() function in H5Ofill.c. The leak is
      manifested by running valgrind on test/set_extent.c.

      Previously, fill->buf is used for datatype conversion 
      if it is large enough and the variable-length information 
      is therefore lost. A buffer is now allocated regardless 
      so that the element in fill->buf can later be reclaimed.

      Fixes Jira issue HDFFV-10840
 

    Java Library
    ------------
    - Fixed switch case 'L' block missing a break statement.

      The HDF5Array.arrayify method is missing a break statement in the case 'L': section
      which causes it to fall through and throw an HDF5JavaException when attempting to
      read an Array[Array[Long]].

      The error was fixed by inserting a break statement at the end of the case 'L': sections.

      Fixes GitHub issue #3056


    Configuration
    -------------
    - Fix Intel oneAPI -loopopt Fortran option being detected as a linker flag.

      Intel's new oneAPI Fortran compiler takes a -loopopt flag that is
      interpreted as a linker flag by Autoconf 2.69 and earlier. This bug
      only affects the Autotools when building with Intel's oneAPI when
      Fortran is enabled.

      This was fixed by changing the required minimum version of Autoconf
      to 2.71 in configure.ac. The release source code will be processed
      with Autoconf 2.71 or later.

    - The accum test now passes on macOS 12+ (Monterey) with CMake.

      Due to changes in the way macOS handles LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the accum test
      started failing on macOS 12+ when building with CMake. CMake has been
      updated to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on macOS and the test now passes.

      Fixes GitHub #2994, #2261, and #1289

    - Fixed syntax of generator expressions used by CMake.

      Adding quotes around the generator expression should allow CMake to
      correctly parse the expression. Generator expressions are typically
      parsed after command arguments. If a generator expression contains
      spaces, new lines, semicolons or other characters that may be
      interpreted as command argument separators, the whole expression
      should be surrounded by quotes when passed to a command. Failure to
      do so may result in the expression being split and it may no longer
      be recognized as a generator expression.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2906

    - Correct the CMake generated pkg-config file

      The pkg-config file generated by CMake had the order and placement of the
      libraries wrong. This release adds support for debug library names.

      This release also changes the order of Libs.private libraries so that 
      dependencies come after dependents. However, the release did not move the 
      compression libraries into Requires.private because there was not a way to 
      determine if the compression libraries had supported pkconfig files. It is 
      still recommended that the CMake config file method be used for building 
      projects with CMake.

      Fixes GitHub issues #1546 and #2259

    - Change the settings of the *pc files to use the correct format.

      The pkg-config files generated by CMake uses incorrect syntax for the 'Requires'
      settings. Changing the set to use 'lib-name = version' instead 'lib-name-version'
      fixes the issue.

      Fixes Jira issue HDFFV-11355

    - Move MPI libraries link from PRIVATE to PUBLIC.

      The install dependencies were not including the need for MPI libraries when
      an application or library was built with the C library. Also updated the
      CMake target link command to use the newer style MPI::MPI_C link variable.


    Tools
    -----
    - Added option --no-compact-subset to h5diff.

     When the name of an object contains square brackets, h5diff was not able
     to parse it correctly because “[ ]” were interpreted as the compact form
     of subsetting.

     h5dump has the special argument, --no-compact-subset to allow the use of
     ‘[‘ and ‘]’ in dataset names.  h5diff now has this option as well.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2682

    - Replaced the H5TOOLS_GOTO_ERROR with just H5TOOLS_ERROR.

      In the tools traverse function, an error in either visit call
      will bypass the cleanup of the local data variables.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2598

    - Fixed h5repack to only print output when verbose option is selected.

      When timing option was added to h5repack, the check for verbose was
      incorrectly implemented.

      Fixes GitHub issue #2270

Known Problems
==============

    testflushrefresh.sh will fail when run with "make check-passthrough-vol"
    on centos7, with 3 Errors/Segmentation faults. These will not occur when
    run with "make check". See https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues/673
    for details.

    The t_bigio test fails on several HPC platforms, generally by timeout with
    OpenMPI 4.0.0 or with this error from spectrum-mpi:
        *** on communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
        *** MPI_ERR_COUNT: invalid count argument

    CMake files do not behave correctly with paths containing spaces.
    Do not use spaces in paths because the required escaping for handling spaces
    results in very complex and fragile build files.
    ADB - 2019/05/07

    At present, metadata cache images may not be generated by parallel
    applications. Parallel applications can read files with metadata cache
    images, but since this is a collective operation, a deadlock is possible
    if one or more processes do not participate.

    CPP ptable test fails on both VS2017 and VS2019 with Intel and Clang compilers,
    JIRA issue: HDFFV-10628. This test will pass with VS2015 with Intel compiler.

    The subsetting option in ph5diff currently will fail and should be avoided.
    The subsetting option works correctly in serial h5diff.

    Known problems in previous releases can be found in the HISTORY*.txt files
    in the HDF5 source. Please report any new problems found to
    help@hdfgroup.org.


CMake vs. Autotools installations
=================================
While both build systems produce similar results, there are differences.
Each system produces the same set of folders on linux (only CMake works
on standard Windows); bin, include, lib and share. Autotools places the
COPYING and RELEASE.txt file in the root folder, CMake places them in
the share folder.

The bin folder contains the tools and the build scripts. Additionally, CMake
creates dynamic versions of the tools with the suffix "-shared". Autotools
installs one set of tools depending on the "--enable-shared" configuration
option.
  build scripts
  -------------
  Autotools: h5c++, h5cc, h5fc
  CMake: h5c++, h5cc, h5hlc++, h5hlcc

The include folder holds the header files and the fortran mod files. CMake
places the fortran mod files into separate shared and static subfolders,
while Autotools places one set of mod files into the include folder. Because
CMake produces a tools library, the header files for tools will appear in
the include folder.

The lib folder contains the library files, and CMake adds the pkgconfig
subfolder with the hdf5*.pc files used by the bin/build scripts created by
the CMake build. CMake separates the C interface code from the fortran code by
creating C-stub libraries for each Fortran library. In addition, only CMake
installs the tools library. The names of the szip libraries are different
between the build systems.

The share folder will have the most differences because CMake builds include
a number of CMake specific files for support of CMake's find_package and support
for the HDF5 Examples CMake project.

The issues with the gif tool are:
    HDFFV-10592 CVE-2018-17433
    HDFFV-10593 CVE-2018-17436
    HDFFV-11048 CVE-2020-10809
These CVE issues have not yet been addressed and can be avoided by not building
the gif tool. Disable building the High-Level tools with these options:
    autotools:   --disable-hltools
    cmake:       HDF5_BUILD_HL_TOOLS=OFF

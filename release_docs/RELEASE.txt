New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - [Example] New feature 
      (EIP - 2014/04/14)
    - 
    
    Library
    -------
    - 
 
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Optimize the chunk fill algorithm of datasets by writing out all
      the chunk fill values collectively in a single MPI-IO
      call. Previously it was done independently by rank 0
      one block at a time. This should show a great performance
      improvement when creating chunked datasets in parallel when the
      chunk dimensions are fairly small.

    - H5I_INVALID_HID replaces 0 to initialize data member "id" in classes
      that represent HDF5 objects.  For PropList, H5P_DEFAULT is used
      instead of H5I_INVALID_HID. (HDFFV-4259, 2014/09/30 -BMR)



Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
                                  

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.13
===========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - CMake: Removed module name from package list of fortran modules because
      that module was never generated. This was only an issue for Fortran
      compliers that are not F2003 compatible. (ADB - 2014/10/16 HDFFV-8932).
    - Library version number is changed due to interface changes since
      previous version 1.8.13. (AKC - 2014/10/03 HDFFV-8937).
    - Mac platforms now builds library with "-O3" optimization when the
      default clang compiler is used. (AKC - 2014/10/01 HDFFV-8933).
    - CMake: Propagated configure test changes to H5_LDOUBLE_TO_INTEGER_WORKS_TEST
      and H5_ULLONG_TO_LDOUBLE_PRECISION_TEST to ConfigureChecks.cmake (added
      stdlib.h and string.h in HDFTests.c file). (ADB - 2014/09/02 HDFFV-8845)
    - CMake: removed parallel test, t_posix_compliant, because source file
      was removed from library. (ADB - 2014/8/14 HDFFV-8880)
    - Autotools: Bison was upgraded to 2.7 and flex upgraded to 2.5.37. The 
      bin/reconfigure script now will execute bison and flex and update the 
      hl/src files. (ADB - 2014/06/16 HDFFV-8709)
    - Autotools: m4 upgraded to 1.4.17. (ADB - 2014/06/12 HDFFV-8743)
    - Autotools: Modified configure to add an entry at the beginning of AM_LDFLAGS 
      for the hdf5 install directory.  Without this entry the relink commands 
      invoked by "make install" to create libraries dependent on libhdf5.so added 
      a dependency on the first libhdf5.so found in any directory in AM_LDFLAGS 
      regardless of its version.  (LRK - 2014/10/17 HDFFV-8944)

    - Changed autotools build behavior

      The Fortran HL library does not compile if the default size of a REAL is
      DOUBLE PRECISION; build fails during compilation.

      Configure now checks for: if REAL is DOUBLE PRECISION, Fortran is enabled and
      HL library is enabled. If this is true then configure will stop with an error
      message.

      (MSB - 2014/8/11, HDFFV-8883/HDFFV-889)

    Library
    -------
    - Corrected ID management code that was failing with 'duplicate key
      inserted' error, and was not handling other situations where many/all
      IDs of a type are opened/closed.  (QAK - 2014/10/16 - HDFFV-8930)

    - Removal of DllMain() from static Windows builds. 
      A DllMain() function was added in HDF5 1.8.13 in order to handle win32 thread
      cleanup. The preprocessor #ifdefs around the DllMain function allowed it
      to be compiled when the static library is built, which is incorrect behavior
      and can cause linkage problems in clients.
      The fix was to change the preprocessor #ifdefs to exclude compiling DllMain()
      in static builds. Our DllMain function is now only compiled when the shared, 
      thread-safe library is built on Windows.
      (DER - 2014/06/13 HDFFV-8837)

    - Enforce constraing on page_size parameter in
      H5Pset_core_write_tracking().
      The reference manual states that the page_size parameter cannot be zero.
      This change checks the page_size parameter to ensure it is zero and returns
      an error code if it is.
      (DER - 2014/08/11 HDFFV-8891)

    - H5Ldelete_by_idx() fails on non-existent group name.
      (MSC - 2014/07/31 HDFFV-8888)

    - Bug in test when building Parallel HDF5 on PVFS2.
      Use MPI_File_get_size() instead of stat().
      (MSC - 2014/07/14 HDFFV-8856)

    - MPI-IO driver tries to allocate space for zero-length dataset
      and asserts. Fixed and added a regression test to make sure this
      doesn't happen again.
      (MSC - 2014/07/03 HDFFV-8761)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Performance

    Tools

    Fortran API
    -------
    - Non-standard Fortran
  
      Intrinsic function SIZEOF is non-standard and should be replaced with a 
      standard intrinsic function.

      If the F2008 intrinsic C_SIZEOF and STORAGE_SIZE are available then they will 
      be used instead of the non-standard SIZEOF intrinsic, even when the SIZEOF 
      function is available.

      (MSB - 2014/6/16, HDFFV-8653)

    - Non-functional API
 
      The Fortran wrapper for H5Pget_fill_value_f calls the wrong C API.

      The correct C API, H5Pget_fill_value, was used instead in the C wrapper.

      (MSB - 2014/9/25, HDFFV-8879)

    - Interoperability with C HDF5

      H5literate_f assumes the return value for the callback function to be of type 
      int (or int_f in C). However, in the C wrapper the return value of H5Literate 
      is type herr_t and this could cause interoperability issues.

      The callback function should be declared INTEGER(C_INT) for portability. The
      tests were updated accordingly.

      (MSB - 2014/9/26, HDFFV-8909)

    - Interoperability with C HDF5

      Wrong type cast of constant Fortran INTEGER parameters.

      The following parameter constants types were change from INTEGER to INTEGER(HID_T) 
      to match the C types:

      H5FD_CORE, H5FD_FAMILY, H5FD_LOG, H5FD_MPIO, H5FD_MULTI, H5FD_SEC2, H5FD_STDIO.

      Other internal 'int' types where changed to 'hid_t', which are transparent to the user.

      (MSB - 2014/7/18, HDFFV-8748)

    C++ API
    ------
    - User's patches were applied to remove several potential memory leaks.
      (HDFFV-8928, 2014/09/30 -BMR)
    - H5F_ACC_CREAT was included in the C++ API but the C library doesn't
      allow it at this time, so it is now removed from the C++ API.
      In addition, H5F_ACC_RDONLY and H5F_ACC_RDWR were missing from the
      documentation, and they are now included.
      (HDFFV-8852, 2014/09/29 -BMR)

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Seg faults in H5TBread_field_name and H5TBread_field_name_f

      H5TBread_field_name (H5TBread_field_name_f) seg faults if the name of the field is wrong.

      Both C and Fortran APIs no longer seg fault if the name of the field is wrong, and both APIs
      return a negative value if the field is wrong.

      (MSB - 2014/09/29, HDFFV-8912)

    - Possible data corruption

      Multiple HL APIs have issues,
        (1) the type from the file is re-used as the memory type, and
        (2) no effort is made to ensure the string is actually null-terminated.
     
      All the HL routines now check: for NULL pointers, if they received a string which
      is null terminated, and if string buffers are short enough not to overflow the buffer. 
      The minimum length of the buffers is now used in strncmp to avoid overflow.

      (MSB - 2014/9/29, HDFFV-8670)

    - Behavior change of HL API

      For H5LTdtype_to_text; if a user buffer is passed in along with the 
      length then the function does not truncate at the end of the buffer, but 
      may exceed the end of the user buffer.

      H5LTdtype_to_text was changed to truncate the string if the buffer is 
      to small.

      (MSB - 2014/9/29, HDFFV-8855)

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
     - See entry for HDFFV-8912 above.

    Testing
    -------
    - Fixed incorrect exit code values (was -1) in testframe which is commonly
      used by several test programs. (AKC - 2014/07/22 HDFFV-8881)

Known Problems
==============
* On windows platforms in debug configurations, the VFD flush1 tests will fail
  with the split and multi VFD drivers. These tests will display a modal debug 
  dialog which must be answered or wait for the test timeout to expire.
  The flush1 and flush2 tests will be skipped under debug for this release.
  (ADB - 2014/06/23 - HDFFV-8851)

* CLANG compiler with the options -fcatch-undefined-behavior and -ftrapv
  catches some undefined behavior in the alignment algorithm of the macro DETECT_I
  in H5detect.c (Issue 8147).  Since the algorithm is trying to detect the alignment
  of integers, ideally the flag -fcatch-undefined-behavior shouldn't to be used for
  H5detect.c. In the future, we can separate flags for H5detect.c from the rest of
  the library. (SLU - 2013/10/16)

* Make provided by Solaris fails in "make check". Solaris users should use
  gmake to build and install the HDF5 software. (AKC - 2013/10/08 - HDFFV-8534)

* On OpenVMS, two soft conversion functions (H5T__conv_i_f and H5T__conv_f_i)
  have bugs.  They convert data between floating-point numbers and integers.
  But the library's default is hard conversion.  The user should avoid
  explicitly enabling soft conversion between floating-point numbers and
  integers. (Issue VMS-8; SLU - 2013/09/19)

* On OpenVMS, ZLIB 1.2.8 library doesn't work properly.  ZLIB 1.2.5 works
  fine.  So please use ZLIB 1.2.5 to build HDF5 library. (Issue VMS-5;
  SLU 2013/09/19)  

* When building using the Cray compilers on Cray machines, HDF5
  configure mistakenly thinks the compiler is an intel compiler and
  sets the -std=c99 flag which breaks configure on Cray. To build HDF5
  properly on a Cray machine, please consult with the instructions in
  INSTALL_parallel for building on Hopper.
  (MSC - 2013/04/26 - HDFFV-8429)

* The h5dump and h5diff utilities occasionally produce different output
  between Linux and Windows systems. This is caused by lower-level library
  routines that fail to write fill values to the user's buffer when reading
  unallocated chunks from datasets that have a fill value set to
  H5D_FILL_VALUE_DEFAULT. Due to platform differences the return of
  spurious data values has only been encountered on Windows 32-bit systems.
  (Issue HDFFV-8247; JP - 2013/03/27)

* The 5.9 C++ compiler on Sun failed to compile a C++ test ttypes.cpp.  It 
  complains with this message:
      "/home/hdf5/src/H5Vprivate.h", line 130: Error: __func__ is not defined.
  
  The reason is that __func__ is a predefined identifier in C99 standard.  The
  HDF5 C library uses it in H5private.h.  The test ttypes.cpp includes 
  H5private.h (H5Tpkg.h<-H5Fprivate.h<-H5Vprivate.h<-H5private.h).  Sun's 5.9
  C++ compiler doesn't support __func__, thus fails to compile the C++ test.
  But Sun's 5.11 C++ compiler does.  To check whether your Sun C++ compiler 
  knows this identifier, try to compile the following simple C++ program:
      #include<stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          printf("%s\n", __func__);
          return 0;
      }
  (SLU - 2012/11/5)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD with the
  native release 8.2 compilers (4.2.1), but are working with gcc 4.6 from the
  ports (and probably gcc releases after that).
  (QAK - 2012/10/19)

* The following h5dump test case fails in BG/P machines (and potentially other
  machines that use a command script to launch executables):

   h5dump --no-compact-subset -d "AHFINDERDIRECT::ah_centroid_t[0] it=0 tl=0"
     tno-subset.h5
  
  This is due to the embedded spaces in the dataset name being interpreted
  by the command script launcher as meta-characters, thus passing three
  arguments to h5dump's -d flag. The command passes if run by hand, just
  not via the test script.
  (AKC - 2012/05/03)

* On hopper, the build failed when RUNSERIAL and RUNPARALLEL are set
  to aprun -np X, because the H5lib_settings.c file was not generated
  properly. Not setting those environment variables works, because
  configure was able to automatically detect that it's a Cray system
  and used the proper launch commands when necessary. 
  (MSC - 2012/04/18)

* The data conversion test dt_arith.c fails in "long double" to integer
  conversion on Ubuntu 11.10 (3.0.0.13 kernel) with GCC 4.6.1 if the library
  is built with optimization -O3 or -O2.  The older GCC (4.5) or newer kernal
  (3.2.2 on Fedora) doesn't have the problem.  Users should lower the 
  optimization level (-O1 or -O0) by defining CFLAGS in the command line of 
  "configure" like:

      CFLAGS=-O1 ./configure

  This will overwrite the library's default optimization level.
  (SLU - 2012/02/07 - HDFFV-7829)
  This issue is no longer present on Ubuntu 12.10 (3.5.0 kernel) with 
  gcc 4.7.2.

* The STDIO VFD does not work on some architectures, possibly due to 32/64
  bit or large file issues.  The basic STDIO VFD test is known to fail on
  64-bit SunOS 5.10 on SPARC when built with -m64 and 32-bit OS X/Darwin
  10.7.0.  The STDIO VFD test has been disabled while we investigate and
  a fix should appear in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-8235)

* h5diff can report inconsistent results when comparing datasets of enum type
  that contain invalid values.  This is due to how enum types are handled in
  the library and will be addressed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7527)

* The links test can fail under the stdio VFD due to some issues with external
  links.  This will be investigated and fixed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7768)

* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure 
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 - HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems 
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If 
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value.
  (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD.
  (QAK - 2011/04/26)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. We are looking into the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries
  should now be working as intended, however.
  (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* The --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2.
  (AKC - 2011/03/10)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/
  (NAF - 2011/01/19)

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user 
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as 
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  (SLU - 2010/02/02)

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.
  (MAM - 2009/11/04)
  
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO.
  (CMC - 2009/04/28)

* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  (SLU - 2005/06/30)

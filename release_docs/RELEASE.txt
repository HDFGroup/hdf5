New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - CMake option to use MSVC naming conventions with MinGW

      HDF5_MSVC_NAMING_CONVENTION option enable to use MSVC naming conventions
      when using a MinGW toolchain

      (xan - 2020/10/30)

    - CMake option to statically link gcc libs with MinGW

      HDF5_MINGW_STATIC_GCC_LIBS allows to statically link libg/libstdc++
      with the MinGW toolchain

      (xan - 2020/10/30)

    - CMake option to build the HDF filter plugins project as an external project

      The HDF filter plugins project is a collection of registered compression
      filters that can be dynamically loaded when needed to access data stored
      in a hdf5 file. This CMake-only option allows the plugins to be built and
      distributed with the hdf5 library and tools. Like the options for szip and
      zlib, either a tgz file or a git repository can be specified for the source.

      The necessary options are (see the INSTALL_CMake.txt file):
          HDF5_ENABLE_PLUGIN_SUPPORT
          PLUGIN_TGZ_NAME or PLUGIN_GIT_URL
      There are more options necessary for various filters and the plugin project
      documents should be referenced.

      (ADB - 2020/10/16, OESS-98)

    - Added CMake option to format source files

      HDF5_ENABLE_FORMATTERS option will enable creation of targets using the
      pattern - HDF5_*_SRC_FORMAT - where * corresponds to the source folder
      or tool folder. All sources can be formatted by executing the format target;
         make format

      (ADB - 2020/09/24)

    - CMake option to link the generated Fortran MOD files into the include
      directory.

      The Fortran generation of MOD files by a Fortran compile can produce
      different binary files between SHARED and STATIC compiles with different
      compilers and/or different platforms. Note that it has been found that
      different versions of Fortran compilers will produce incompatible MOD
      files. Currently, CMake will locate these MOD files in subfolders of
      the include directory and add that path to the Fortran library target
      in the CMake config file, which can be used by the CMake find library
      process. For other build systems using the binary from a CMake install,
      a new CMake configuration can be used to copy the pre-chosen version
      of the Fortran MOD files into the install include directory.

      The default will depend on the configuration of
      BUILD_STATIC_LIBS and BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:
            YES                   YES         Default to SHARED
            YES                   NO          Default to STATIC
            NO                    YES         Default to SHARED
            NO                    NO          Default to SHARED
      The defaults can be overriden by setting the config option
         HDF5_INSTALL_MOD_FORTRAN to one of NO, SHARED, or STATIC

      (ADB - 2020/07/9, HDFFV-11116)

    - CMake option to use AEC (open source SZip) library instead of SZip

      The open source AEC library is a replacement library for SZip. In
      order to use it for hdf5 the libaec CMake source was changed to add
      "-fPIC" and exclude test files. Autotools does not build the
      compression libraries within hdf5 builds. New option USE_LIBAEC is
      required to compensate for the different files produced by AEC build.

      (ADB - 2020/04/22, OESS-65)

    - CMake ConfigureChecks.cmake file now uses CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER

      Some handcrafted tests in HDFTests.c has been removed and the CMake
      CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER module has been used.

      (ADB - 2020/03/24, TRILAB-24)

    - Both build systems use same set of warnings flags

      GNU C, C++ and gfortran warnings flags were moved to files in a config
      sub-folder named gnu-warnings. Flags that only are available for a specific
      version of the compiler are in files named with that version.
      Clang C warnings flags were moved to files in a config sub-folder
      named clang-warnings.
      Intel C, Fortran warnings flags were moved to files in a config sub-folder
      named intel-warnings.

      There are flags in named "error-xxx" files with warnings that may
      be promoted to errors. Some source files may still need fixes.

      There are also pairs of files named "developer-xxx" and "no-developer-xxx"
      that are chosen by the CMake option:HDF5_ENABLE_DEV_WARNINGS or the
      configure option:--enable-developer-warnings.

      In addition, CMake no longer applies these warnings for examples.

      (ADB - 2020/03/24, TRILAB-192)

    - Update CMake minimum version to 3.12

      Updated CMake minimum version to 3.12 and added version checks
      for Windows features.

      (ADB - 2020/02/05, TRILABS-142)

    - Fixed CMake include properties for Fortran libraries

      Corrected the library properties for Fortran to use the
      correct path for the Fortran module files.

      (ADB - 2020/02/04, HDFFV-11012)

    - Added common warnings files for gnu and intel

      Added warnings files to use one common set of flags
      during configure for both autotools and CMake build
      systems. The initial implementation only affects a
      general set of flags for gnu and intel compilers.

      (ADB - 2020/01/17)

    - Added new options to CMake for control of testing

      Added CMake options (default ON);
          HDF5_TEST_SERIAL AND/OR HDF5_TEST_PARALLEL
          combined with:
            HDF5_TEST_TOOLS
            HDF5_TEST_EXAMPLES
            HDF5_TEST_FORTRAN
            HDF5_TEST_CPP

      (ADB - 2020/01/15, HDFFV-11001)

    - Added Clang sanitizers to CMake for analyzer support if compiler is clang.

      Added CMake code and files to execute the Clang sanitizers if
      HDF5_ENABLE_SANITIZERS is enabled and the USE_SANITIZER option
      is set to one of the following:
          Address
          Memory
          MemoryWithOrigins
          Undefined
          Thread
          Leak
          'Address;Undefined'

      (ADB - 2019/12/12, TRILAB-135)

    - Update CMake for VS2019 support

      CMake added support for VS2019 in version 3.15. Changes to the CMake
      generator setting required changes to scripts. Also updated version
      references in CMake files as necessary.

      (ADB - 2019/11/18, HDFFV-10962)

    - Add options to enable or disable building tools and tests

      Configure options --enable-tests and --enable-tools were added for
      autotools configure.  These options are enabled by default, and can be
      disabled with either --disable-tests (or tools) or --enable-tests=no
      (or --enable-tools=no).  Build time is reduced ~20% when tools are
      disabled, 35% when tests are disabled, 45% when both are disabled.
      Reenabling them after the initial build requires running configure
      again with the option(s) enabled.

      (DAP - 2019/07/24, HDFFV-9976)

    - Update CMake tests to use FIXTURES

      CMake test fixtures allow setup/cleanup tests and other dependency
      requirements as properties for tests. This is more flexible for
      modern CMake code.

      (ADB - 2019/07/23, HDFFV-10529)

    - Windows PDB files are always installed

      There are build configuration or flag settings for Windows that may not
      generate PDB files. If those files are not generated then the install
      utility will fail because those PDB files are not found. An optional
      variable, DISABLE_PDB_FILES, was added to not install PDB files.

      (ADB - 2019/07/17, HDFFV-10424)

    - Add mingw CMake support with a toolchain file

      There has been a number of mingw issues that has been linked under
      HDFFV-10845. It has been decided to implement the CMake cross-compiling
      technique of toolchain files. We will use a linux platform with the mingw
      compiler stack for testing. Only the C language is fully supported, and
      the error tests are skipped. The C++ language works for static but shared
      builds has a shared library issue with the mingw Standard Exception Handling
      library, which is not available on Windows. Fortran has a common cross-compile
      problem with the fortran configure tests.

      (ADB - 2019/07/12, HDFFV-10845, HDFFV-10595)

    - Windows PDB files are installed incorrectly

      For static builds, the PDB files for windows should be installed next
      to the static libraries in the lib folder. Also the debug versions of
      libraries and PDB files are now correctly built using the default
      CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX setting.

      (ADB - 2019/07/09, HDFFV-10581)

    - Add option to build only shared libs

      A request was made to prevent building static libraries and only build
      shared.  A new option was added to CMake, ONLY_SHARED_LIBS, which will
      skip building static libraries. Certain utility functions will build with
      static libs but are not published. Tests are adjusted to use the correct
      libraries depending on SHARED/STATIC settings.

      (ADB - 2019/06/12, HDFFV-10805)

    - Add toolchain and cross-compile support

      Added info on using a toolchain file to INSTALL_CMAKE.txt. A
      toolchain file is also used in cross-compiling, which requires
      CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR to be set. To help with cross-compiling
      the fortran configure process, the HDF5UseFortran.cmake file macros
      were improved. Fixed a Fortran configure file issue that incorrectly
      used #cmakedefine instead of #define.

      (ADB - 2018/10/04, HDFFV-10594)

    - Add warning flags for Intel compilers

      Identified Intel compiler specific warnings flags that should be used
      instead of GNU flags.

      (ADB - 2018/10/04, TRILABS-21)

    - Add default rpath to targets

      Default rpaths should be set in shared executables and
      libraries to allow the use of loading dependent libraries
      without requiring LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set. The default
      path should be relative using @rpath on osx and $ORIGIN
      on linux. Windows is not affected.

      (ADB - 2018/09/26, HDFFV-10594)


    Library
    -------
    - Add S3 and HDFS VFDs to HDF5 maintenance

      Fix windows requirements and java tests. Windows requires CMake 3.13.
            Install openssl library (with dev files);
            from "Shining Light Productions". msi package preferred.

            PATH should have been updated with the installation dir.
            set ENV variable OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR to the installation dir.
            set ENV variable OPENSSL_CONF to the cfg file, likely %OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR%\bin\openssl.cfg
            Install libcurl library (with dev files);
            download the latest released version using git: https://github.com/curl/curl.git

            Open a Visual Studio Command prompt
            change to the libcurl root folder
            run the "buildconf.bat" batch file
            change to the winbuild directory
            nmake /f Makefile.vc mode=dll MACHINE=x64
            copy libcurl-vc-x64-release-dll-ipv6-sspi-winssl dir to C:\curl (installation dir)
            set ENV variable CURL_ROOT to C:\curl (installation dir)
            update PATH ENV variable to %CURL_ROOT%\bin (installation bin dir).
            the aws credentials file should be in %USERPROFILE%\.aws folder
            set the ENV variable "HDF5_ROS3_TEST_BUCKET_URL=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hdf5ros3"

      (ADB - 2019/09/12, HDFFV-10854)

    - Allow pre-generated H5Tinit.c and H5make_libsettings.c to be used.

      Rather than always running H5detect and generating H5Tinit.c and
      H5make_libsettings.c, supply a location for those files.

===================================================



Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.21
===========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Correct option for default API version

      CMake options for default API version are not mutually exclusive.
      Change the multiple BOOL options to a single STRING option with the
      strings; v16, v18.

      (ADB - 2019/08/12, HDFFV-10879)


    Library
    -------
    - Explicitly declared dlopen to use RTLD_LOCAL

      dlopen documentation states that if neither RTLD_GLOBAL nor
      RTLD_LOCAL are specified, then the default behavior is unspecified.
      The default on linux is usually RTLD_LOCAL while macos will default
      to RTLD_GLOBAL.

      (ADB - 2020/08/12, HDFFV-11127)

    - Fixed issues CVE-2018-13870 and CVE-2018-13869

      When a buffer overflow occurred because a name length was corrupted
      and became very large, h5dump crashed on memory access violation.

      A check for reading past the end of the buffer was added to multiple
      locations to prevent the crashes and h5dump now simply fails with an
      error message when this error condition occurs.

      (BMR - 2020/7/31, HDFFV-11120 and HDFFV-11121)

    - Fixed the segmentation fault when reading attributes with multiple threads

      It was reported that the reading of attributes with variable length string
      datatype will crash with segmentation fault particularly when the number of
      threads is high (>16 threads).  The problem was due to the file pointer that
      was set in the variable length string datatype for the attribute.  That file
      pointer was already closed when the attribute was accessed.

      The problem was fixed by setting the file pointer to the current opened file pointer
      when the attribute was accessed.  Similar patch up was done before when reading
      dataset with variable length string datatype.

      (VC - 2020/07/13, HDFFV-11080)

    - Fixed CVE-2018-17435

      The tool h52gif produced a segfault when the size of an attribute
      message was corrupted and caused a buffer overflow.

      The problem was fixed by verifying the attribute message's size
      against the buffer size before accessing the buffer.  h52gif was
      also fixed to display the failure instead of silently exiting
      after the segfault was eliminated.

      (BMR - 2020/6/19, HDFFV-10591)

    - Fixed user-created data access properties not existing in the property list
      returned by H5Dget_access_plist. Thanks to Steven Varga for submitting a
      reproducer and a patch.

      (CJH - 2019/12/09, HDFFV-10934)

    - Fixed a bug that could cause an error or cause fill values to be
      incorrectly read from a dataset that was written to using H5Dwrite_chunk
      if the dataset was not closed after writing.

      (NAF - 2019/03/06, HDFFV-10716)

    - Fixed a potential invalid memory access and failure that could occur when
      decoding an unknown object header message (from a future version of the
      library).

      (NAF - 2019/01/07)

    - Allow H5detect and H5make_libsettings to take a file as an argument.

      Rather than only writing to stdout, add a command argument to name
      the file that H5detect and H5make_libsettings will use for output.
      Without an argument, stdout is still used, so backwards compatibility
      is maintained.

      (ADB - 2018/09/05, HDFFV-9059)


    - Inappropriate linking with deprecated MPI C++ libraries

      HDF5 does not define *_SKIP_MPICXX in the public headers, so applications
      can inadvertently wind up linking to the deprecated MPI C++ wrappers.

      MPICH_SKIP_MPICXX and OMPI_SKIP_MPICXX have both been defined in H5public.h
      so this should no longer be an issue. HDF5 makes no use of the deprecated
      MPI C++ wrappers.

      (DER - 2019/09/17, HDFFV-10893)

    Tools
    -----
    - h5repack was fixed to repack the reference attributes properly.
      The code line that checks if the update of reference inside a compound
      datatype is misplaced outside the code block loop that carries out the
      check. In consequence, the next attribute that is not the reference
      type was repacked again as the reference type and caused the failure of
      repacking. The fix is to move the corresponding code line to the correct
      code block.

      (KY -2020/02/05, HDFFV-11014)


    - h5repack was fixed to repack datasets with external storage
      to other types of storage.

      New test added to repack files and verify the correct data using h5diff.

      (JS - 2019/09/25, HDFFV-10408)
      (ADB - 2019/10/02, HDFFV-10918)


    Fortran API
    -----------
    - Added symbolic links libhdf5_hl_fortran.so to libhdf5hl_fortran.so and
      libhdf5_hl_fortran.a to libhdf5hl_fortran.a in hdf5/lib directory for
      autotools installs.  These were added to match the name of the files
      installed by CMmake and the general pattern of hl lib files.  We will
      change the names of the installed lib files to the matching name in
      the next major release.

Known Problems
==============

    The dynamically loaded plugin test libraries require undefined references
    to HDF5 functions to be resolved at runtime in order to function properly.
    With autotools on CYGWIN this results in build errors, and we have not
    found a solution that satisfies both.  Therefore the dynamically loaded
    plugin tests have been disabled on CYGWIN.

    Mac OS X 10.13 added additional subdirectory structure in .libs for shared
    libraries.  Consequently "make check" will fail testing java and dynamically
    loaded plugin test libraries attempting to copy files from the previous
    locations in .libs directories.  This will be addressed in the next release
    when support for the Mac OS X 10.13 platform is added.

    Known problems in previous releases can be found in the HISTORY*.txt files
    in the HDF5 source. Please report any new problems found to
    help@hdfgroup.org.


CMake vs. Autotools installations
=================================
While both build systems produce similar results, there are differences.
Each system produces the same set of folders on linux (only CMake works
on standard Windows); bin, include, lib and share. Autotools places the
COPYING and RELEASE.txt file in the root folder, CMake places them in
the share folder.

The bin folder contains the tools and the build scripts. Additionally, CMake
creates dynamic versions of the tools with the suffix "-shared". Autotools
installs one set of tools depending on the "--enable-shared" configuration
option.
  build scripts
  -------------
  Autotools: h5c++, h5cc, h5fc
  CMake: h5c++, h5cc, h5hlc++, h5hlcc

The include folder holds the header files and the fortran mod files. CMake
places the fortran mod files into separate shared and static subfolders,
while Autotools places one set of mod files into the include folder. Because
CMake produces a tools library, the header files for tools will appear in
the include folder.

The lib folder contains the library files, and CMake adds the pkgconfig
subfolder with the hdf5*.pc files used by the bin/build scripts created by
the CMake build. CMake separates the C interface code from the fortran code by
creating C-stub libraries for each Fortran library. In addition, only CMake
installs the tools library. The names of the szip libraries are different
between the build systems.

The share folder will have the most differences because CMake builds include
a number of CMake specific files for support of CMake's find_package and support
for the HDF5 Examples CMake project.

New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - A new tool, cmakehdf5, which is a build command script similar to
      buildhdf5 is added and is available in the bin directory.
      (AKC - 2013/01/21)

    Library
    -------
    - Updated to latest autotools and changed all hard *.sh scripts to
      configure managed *.sh.in files. Removed overloading of autotools
      TESTS variable by examples and tests. Renamed configure.in to
      configure.ac. (ADB - 2012/08/23 - HDFFV-8129)
    - The data sieve buffer size was set for all the datasets in the file.  It
      could waste memory if any dataset size is smaller than the sieve buffer
      size.  Now the library picks the smaller one between the dataset size
      and the sieve buffer size from the file access property. See Issue 7934.
      (SLU - 2012/4/11)
 
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Added the H5Pget_mpio_no_collective_cause() function that retrieves 
      reasons why the collective I/O was broken during read/write IO access. 
      (JKM - 2012/08/30 HDFFV-8143)

    - Added H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode_f (MSB - 2012/09/27)
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5import: Changed to allow the use of h5dump output as input files to 
      h5import. h5dump must include the "-p" option to print the properties; 
      configuration file is captured output of h5dump. The restrictions are 
      that only one dataset with a simple datatype (integer, floating-point, 
      or string) can be processed. Integers and floating-point imports from 
      h5dump must use the "binary" option for the data file. The string version 
      uses the h5dump "-y --width=1" options to disable the indexing printouts, 
      print single columns, and obviously NOT use the "binary" option. 
      (ADB - 2012/07/19 HDFFV-721)

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - None

    Fortran API
    -----------
    - Fixed a typo in return value of the nh5dread_f_c function (was 1 
      instead of 0 on success); fixed the return value to make it consistent
      with other Fortran functions; cleaned debug statements from the code.
      (EIP - 2012/06/23)

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - None

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.10
===========================
    Library
    -------
    - The library now behaves correctly when performing large I/O operations on
      Mac OS-X.  Previously, single I/O operations > 2 GB would fail since the
      Darwin read/write calls cannot handle the number of bytes that their
      parameter types imply.
      Fixes HDFFV-7975 and HDFFV-8240 (DER - 07 JAN 2013)
    - Fixed a bug in the core VFD that cause failures when opening files > 2 GB.
      Fixes HDFFV-8124 and HDFFV-8158 (DER - 07 JAN 2013)

    Tools
    -----
    - The following h5stat test case failed in BG/P machines (and potentially
      other machines that display extra output if an MPI task returns with a
      non-zero code.)
        Testing h5stat notexist.h5
      The test script was fixed to ignore the extra output.
      HDFFV-8233 (AKC - 2012/12/17)
    - h5diff: Fixed slowness when comparing HDF5 files with many attributes. 
      Much slower performance was identified with later release version 
      (from 1.8.7 to 1.8.10) compared to 1.8.6. The issue was introduced 
      from fixing an attribute related bug for 1.8.7 release in the past.
      HDFFV-8145 (JKM 2012/12/13)

    Testing
    -------
    - None

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.9
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Fixed configure --enable-production to not use -O optimization for Lion
      and Mountain Lion systems when gcc (i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2
      (GCC) 4.2.1) is used.  Somehow the -O optimization will cause some of
      the hard conversion code in test/dt_arith.c to fail. HDFFV-8017.
      (AKC - 2012/10/10)
    - Fixed AIX Fortran compiler flags to use appropriate settings for
      debugging, profiling, and optimization situations. HDFFV-8069. 
      (AKC 2012/09/27)

    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a memory leak exposed when inserting/removing a property
      from a property list several times. HDFFV-8022. (MSC 2012/05/18)
    - The file_image test will fail in the "initial file image and callbacks in
      the core VFD" sub-test if the source directory is read-only as the test
      fails to create its test files in the build directory. This has been
      fixed. HDFFV-8009 (AKC - 2012/07/06)
  

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - The MPI-POSIX VFD was updated to include the POSIX and Windows
      correctness features added that had already been added to the other VFDs.
      HDFFV-8058/7845.  (DER 2012/09/17)

    Performance
    -------------
    - Removed program perform/benchpar from the enable-build-all list.  The
      program will be retired or moved to another location.  HDFFV-8156
      (AKC 2012/10/01)
    - Retired program perform/mpi-perf. Its purpose has been incorporated
      into h5perf. (AKC 2012/09/21)

    Tools
    -----
    - h5repack: "h5repack -f NONE file1.h5 out.h5" command failed if
      source file contains chunked dataset and a chunk dim is bigger than 
      the dataset dim. Another issue is that the command changed max dims
      if chunk dim is smaller than the dataset dim. These issue occurred 
      when dataset size is smaller than 64k (compact size limit)  Fixed both.
      HDFFV-8012 (JKM 2012/09/24)
    - h5diff: Fixed the counter in verbose mode (-v, -r) so that it will no 
      longer add together the differences between datasets and the differences 
      between attributes of those datasets. This change makes the output of 
      verbose mode consistent for datasets, groups, and committed datatypes. 
      HDFFV-5919 (JKM 2012/09/10)
    - h5diff: Fixed the incorrect result when comparing attribute data 
      values and the data type has the same class but different sizes.
      HDFFV-7942  (JKM 2012/08/15)
    - h5dump: Replaced single element fwrite with block writes.
      HDFFV-1208 (ADB 2012/08/13)
    - h5diff: Fixed test failure for "make check" due to failure of 
      copying test files when performed in HDF5 source tree. Also applied
      to other tools.  HDFFV-8107 (JKM 2012/08/01)
    - ph5diff: Fixed intermittent hang issue on a certain operation in 
      parallel mode. It was detected by daily test for comparing 
      non-comparable objects, but it could have occurred in other 
      operations depending on machine condition.  HDFFV-8003 (JKM 2012/08/01)
    - h5diff: Fixed the function COPY_TESTFILES_TO_TESTDIR() of testh5diff.sh
      to better report when there is an error in the file copying.
      HDFFV-8105 (AKC 2012/07/22)
    - h5dump: Fixed the sort by name display to maintain correct parent/child
      relationships between ascending/descending order.
      HDFFV-8095 (ADB 2012/07/12)
    - h5dump: Fixed the display by creation order when using option -n 
      (print contents).
      HDFFV-5942 (ADB 2012/07/09)
    - h5dump: Changed to allow H5T_CSET_UTF8 to be displayed in h5dump output. 
      Used technique similar to what was done in h5ls (matches library 
      options).
      HDFFV-7999 (ADB 2012/05/23)
    - h5diff: Fixed the tool so that it will not check and display the status 
      of dangling links without setting the --follow-symlinks option. This 
      also improved performance when comparing lots of external links without 
      the --follow-symlinks option.  
      HDFFV-7998 (JKM 2012/04/26)

    F90 API
    -------
    
    - Fixed a typo in return value of the nh5dread_f_c function (was 1
      instead of 0 on success); fixed the return value to make it consistent
      with other Fortran functions; cleaned debug statements from the code.
      (EIP - 2012/06/23)

    - Fixed a problem writing/reading control characters to a dataset; writing
      a string containing alerts, backspace, carriage_return, form_feed,
      horizontal_tab, vertical_tab, or new_line is now tested and working.
      (MSB - 2012/09/01)

    - Corrected the integer type of H5S_UNLIMITED_F to HSIZE_T (MSB - 2012/09/01)

    - Corrected the number of continuation lines in the src files
      to be less than 32 lines for F95 compliance. (MSB - 2012/10/01)

    C++ API
    ------
    - None

    High-Level APIs:
    ------

    - Fixed problem with H5TBdelete_record destroying all data following the 
      deletion of a row. (MSB- 2012/7/26)

    - Fixed H5LTget_attribute_string not closing an object identifier when an 
      error occurs. (MSB- 2012/7/21)

    - Corrected the return type of H5TBAget_fill from herr_t to htri_t to 
      reflect that a return value of 1 indicates that a fill value is 
      present, 0 indicates a fill value is not present, and <0 indicates an 
      error.

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - None

Known Problems
==============
* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD with the
  native release 8.2 compilers (4.2.1), but are working with gcc 4.6 from the
  ports (and probably gcc releases after that).
  (QAK - 2012/10/19)

* The following h5dump test case fails in BG/P machines (and potentially other
  machines that use a command script to launch executables):

   h5dump --no-compact-subset -d "AHFINDERDIRECT::ah_centroid_t[0] it=0 tl=0"
     tno-subset.h5
  
  This is due to the embedded spaces in the dataset name being interpreted
  by the command script launcher as meta-characters, thus passing three
  arguments to h5dump's -d flag. The command passes if run by hand, just
  not via the test script.
  (AKC - 2012/05/03)

* On hopper, the build failed when RUNSERIAL and RUNPARALLEL are set
  to aprun -np X, because the H5lib_settings.c file was not generated
  properly. Not setting those environment variables works, because
  configure was able to automatically detect that it's a Cray system
  and used the proper launch commands when necessary. 
  (MSC - 2012/04/18)

* The data conversion test dt_arith.c fails in "long double" to integer
  conversion on Ubuntu 11.10 (3.0.0.13 kernal) with GCC 4.6.1 if the library
  is built with optimization -O3 or -O2.  The older GCC (4.5) or newer kernal
  (3.2.2 on Fedora) doesn't have the problem.  Users should lower the 
  optimization level (-O1 or -O0) by defining CFLAGS in the command line of 
  "configure" like:

      CFLAGS=-O1 ./configure

  This will overwrite the library's default optimization level.
  (SLU - 2012/02/07 - HDFFV-7829)

* The STDIO VFD does not work on some architectures, possibly due to 32/64
  bit or large file issues.  The basic STDIO VFD test is known to fail on
  64-bit SunOS 5.10 on SPARC when built with -m64 and 32-bit OS X/Darwin
  10.7.0.  The STDIO VFD test has been disabled while we investigate and
  a fix should appear in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-8235)

* h5diff can report inconsistent results when comparing datasets of enum type
  that contain invalid values.  This is due to how enum types are handled in
  the library and will be addressed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7527)

* The links test can fail under the stdio VFD due to some issues with external
  links.  This will be investigated and fixed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7768)

* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure 
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 - HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems 
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If 
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value.
  (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD.
  (QAK - 2011/04/26)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. We are looking into the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries
  should now be working as intended, however.
  (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* The --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2.
  (AKC - 2011/03/10)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/
  (NAF - 2011/01/19)

* The library's test dt_arith.c showed a compiler's rounding problem on
  Cygwin when converting from unsigned long long to long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works fine.  We defined a macro for Cygwin to
  skip this test until we can solve the problem.
  (SLU - 2010/05/05 - HDFFV-1264)

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user 
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as 
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  (SLU - 2010/02/02)

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.
  (MAM - 2009/11/04)
  
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO.
  (CMC - 2009/04/28)

* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  (SLU - 2005/06/30)

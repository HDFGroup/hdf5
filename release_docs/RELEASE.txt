HDF5 version 1.4.2 currently under development
==============================================================================


INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF5-1.4.1 and
HDF5-1.4.2, and contains information on the platforms tested and
known problems in HDF5-1.4.2. For more details check the HISTORY.txt
file in the HDF5 source.

The HDF5 documentation can be found on the NCSA ftp server
(ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu) in the directory:

     /HDF/HDF5/docs/

New Features
============

    * File sizes greater than 2GB are now supported on Linux systems with
      version 2.4.x or higher kernels.
    * Added a global string variable H5_lib_vers_info_g which holds the
      HDF5 library version information.  This can be used to identify
      an hdf5 library or hdf5 application binary.
      Also added a verification of the consistency between H5_lib_vers_info_g
      and other version information in the source code.
    * Parallel HDF5 now runs on the HP V2500 and HP N4000 machines.
    * F90 API:
        - Added aditional parameter "dims" to the h5dread_f/h5dwrite_f and
          h5aread_f/h5awrite_f subroutines.  This parameter is a 1-D array 
          of size 7 and contains the sizes of the data buffer dimensions. 
          This change enables portability between Windows and UNIX platforms.
          In previous versions of the F90 APIs, the data buffer parameters of 
          the above functions were declared as assumed-shape arrays, which 
          were passed to the C functions by a descriptor.  There is no 
          portable means, however, of passing descriptors from F90 to C, 
          causing portability problems between Windows and UNIX and among
          UNIX platforms.  With this change, the data buffers are assumed-
          size arrays, which can be portably passed to the C functions.
    * F90 static library is available on Windows platforms. 
      See INSTALL_Windows_withF90.txt for details.
    * F90 APIs are available on HPUX 11.00 and 10.20 and IBM SP platforms.
    * H5 <-> GIF convertor has been added. This is available under 
      tools/gifconv. The convertor supports the ability to create animated
      gifs as well.
    * Verified correct operation of library on Solaris 2.8 in both 64-bit and
      32-bit compilation modes.  See INSTALL document for instructions on
      compiling the distribution with 64-bit support.
    * Added support for the Metrowerks Code Warrior compiler for Windows.  
    * For H4->H5 converter utility, added a new option to choose not to convert
      HDF4 specified attributes(reference number, class) into HDF5 attributes.
    * Added support chunking and compression in SDS and image in H4->H5 converter. 
      Currently HDF5 only supports gzip compression, so by default an HDF4 file 
      with any other compression method will be converted into an HDF5 file in 
      gzip compression. 
    * correct the order or reading HDF4 image array in H4->H5 conversion.  
         
Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.1 Release
==================================

    * Fixed bug with non-zero userblock sizes causing raw data to not
      write correctly.
    * Fixed problems with Pablo build and linking with non-standard MPI I/O.
    * Fixed build on Linux systems with --enable-static-exec flag. It now
      works correctly.
    * IMPORTANT: Fixed file metadata corruption bug which could cause 
      metadata data loss in certain situations.
    * The allocation by alignment (H5Pset_alignment) feature code somehow
      got dropped in some 1.3.x version. Re-implemented it with "new and
      improved" algorithm.  It keeps track of "wasted" file-fragment in
      the free-list too.
    * Removed limitation that the data transfer buffer size needed to be
      set for datasets whose dimensions were too large for the 'all' 
      selection code to handle.  Any size dimensioned datasets should be 
      handled correctly now.
    * Changed behavior of H5Tget_member_type to correctly emulate HDF5 v1.2.x
      when --enable-hdf5v1_2 configure flag is enabled.
    * Added --enable-linux-lfs flag to allow more control over whether to 
      enable or disable large file support on Linux.
    * Fixed various bugs releated to SDS dimensional scale conversions in H4->H5 
      converter.
    * Fixed a bug to correctly convert HDF4 objects with fill value into HDF5.



Documentation
=============

    * The H5T_conv_t and H5T_cdata_t structures are now properly defined
      in the H5Tregister entry in the "H5T" section of the "HDF5 Reference 
      Manual" and described in detail in section 12, "Data Conversions," in 
      the "Datatypes" chapter of the "HDF5 User's Guide."
    * The new tools h52gif and gif2h5 have been added to the "Tools" section
      of the Reference Manual.
    * A "Freespace Management" section has been added to the "Performance" 
      chapter of the User's Guide.
    * Several user-reported bugs have been fixed since Release 1.4.1.
    * The "HDF5 Image and Palette Specification" (in the "HDF5 Application
      Developer's Guide") has been heavily revised.  Based on extensive user 
      feedback and input from visualization software developers, Version 1.2 
      of the image specification is substantially different from prior 
      versions.

Known Problems
==============

    * When a dataset with the variable-legth datatype is overwritten, 
      the library can develop memory leaks that cause the file to become 
      unnecessarily large.  This is planned to be fixed in the next release.

    * On the SV1, the h5ls test fails due to a difference between the 
      SV1 printf precision and the printf precision on other platforms.

    * The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output in some
      platforms (e.g. SP2 parallel, Windows) where the error messages
      directed to "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output
      from stdout.  This is not an error.

    * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for HP-UX
      11.00 platforms.

    * The executables are always dynamic on IRIX64 6.5(64 and n32) and 
      IRIX 6.5 even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * IRIX 6.5 fails to compile if configured with --enable-static-exec.
    
    * For 24-bit image conversion from H4->H5, the current conversion is
      not consistent with HDF5 image specification. 

    * After "make install" or "make install-doc" one may need to reload
      the source from the tar file before doing another build.

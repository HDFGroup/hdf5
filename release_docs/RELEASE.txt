New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    - Add CMake variable HDF5_LIB_INFIX

      This infix is added to all library names after 'hdf5'.
      e.g. the infix '_openmpi' results in the library name 'libhdf5_openmpi.so'
      This name is used in packages on debian based systems.
      (see https://packages.debian.org/jessie/amd64/libhdf5-openmpi-8/filelist)

      (barcode - 2021/03/22)

    - On macOS, Universal Binaries can now be built, allowing native execution on
      both Intel and Apple Silicon (ARM) based Macs.

      To do so, set CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64;arm64"

      (SAM - 2021/02/07, https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues/311)

    - Added a configure-time option to control certain compiler warnings
      diagnostics

      A new configure-time option was added that allows some compiler warnings
      diagnostics to have the default operation. This is mainly intended for
      library developers and currently only works for gcc 10 and above. The
      diagnostics flags apply to C, C++ and Fortran compilers and will appear
      in "H5 C Flags", H5 C++ Flags" and H5 Fortran Flags, respectively. They
      will NOT be exported to h5cc, etc.

      The default is OFF, which will disable the warnings URL and color attributes
      for the warnings output. ON will not add the flags and allow default behavior.

      Autotools:    --enable-diags

      CMake:        HDF5_ENABLE_BUILD_DIAGS

      (ADB - 2021/02/05, HDFFV-11213)

    - CMake option to build the HDF filter plugins project as an external project

        The HDF filter plugins project is a collection of registered compression
        filters that can be dynamically loaded when needed to access data stored
        in a hdf5 file. This CMake-only option allows the plugins to be built and
        distributed with the hdf5 library and tools. Like the options for szip and
        zlib, either a tgz file or a git repository can be specified for the source.

        The option was refactored to use the CMake FetchContent process. This allows
        more control over the filter targets, but required external project command
        options to be moved to a CMake include file, HDF5PluginCache.cmake. Also
        enabled the filter examples to be used as tests for operation of the
        filter plugins.

        (ADB - 2020/12/10, OESS-98)

    - FreeBSD Autotools configuration now defaults to 'cc' and 'c++' compilers

      On FreeBSD, the autotools defaulted to 'gcc' as the C compiler and did
      not process C++ options. Since FreeBSD 10, the default compiler has
      been clang (via 'cc').

      The default compilers have been set to 'cc' for C and 'c++' for C++,
      which will pick up clang and clang++ respectively on FreeBSD 10+.
      Additionally, clang options are now set correctly for both C and C++
      and g++ options will now be set if that compiler is being used (an
      omission from the former functionality).

      (DER - 2020/11/28, HDFFV-11193)

    - Fixed POSIX problems when building w/ gcc on Solaris

      When building on Solaris using gcc, the POSIX symbols were not
      being set correctly, which could lead to issues like clock_gettime()
      not being found.

      The standard is now set to gnu99 when building with gcc on Solaris,
      which allows POSIX things to be #defined and linked correctly. This
      differs slightly from the gcc norm, where we set the standard to c99
      and manually set POSIX #define symbols.

      (DER - 2020/11/25, HDFFV-11191)

    - Added a configure-time option to consider certain compiler warnings
      as errors

      A new configure-time option was added that converts some compiler warnings
      to errors. This is mainly intended for library developers and currently
      only works for gcc and clang. The warnings that are considered errors
      will appear in the generated libhdf5.settings file. These warnings apply
      to C and C++ code and will appear in "H5 C Flags" and H5 C++ Flags",
      respectively. They will NOT be exported to h5cc, etc.

      The default is OFF. Building with this option may fail when compiling
      on operating systems and with compiler versions not commonly used by
      the library developers. Compilation may also fail when headers not
      under the control of the library developers (e.g., mpi.h, hdfs.h) raise
      warnings.

      Autotools:    --enable-warnings-as-errors

      CMake:        HDF5_ENABLE_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS

      (DER - 2020/11/23, HDFFV-11189)

    - Autotools and CMake target added to produce doxygen generated documentation

        The default is OFF or disabled.
        Autoconf option is '--enable-doxygen'
          autotools make target is 'doxygen' and will build all doxygen targets
        CMake configure option is 'HDF5_BUILD_DOC'.
          CMake target is 'doxygen' for all available doxygen targets
          CMake target is 'hdf5lib_doc' for the src subdirectory

        (ADB - 2020/11/13)

    - CMake option to use MSVC naming conventions with MinGW

        HDF5_MSVC_NAMING_CONVENTION option enable to use MSVC naming conventions
        when using a MinGW toolchain

        (xan - 2020/10/30)

    - CMake option to statically link gcc libs with MinGW

        HDF5_MINGW_STATIC_GCC_LIBS allows to statically link libg/libstdc++
        with the MinGW toolchain

        (xan - 2020/10/30)

    - CMake option to build the HDF filter plugins project as an external project

        The HDF filter plugins project is a collection of registered compression
        filters that can be dynamically loaded when needed to access data stored
        in a hdf5 file. This CMake-only option allows the plugins to be built and
        distributed with the hdf5 library and tools. Like the options for szip and
        zlib, either a tgz file or a git repository can be specified for the source.

        The necessary options are (see the INSTALL_CMake.txt file):
          HDF5_ENABLE_PLUGIN_SUPPORT
          PLUGIN_TGZ_NAME or PLUGIN_GIT_URL
        There are more options necessary for various filters and the plugin project
        documents should be referenced.

        (ADB - 2020/10/16, OESS-98)

    - Added CMake option to format source files

        HDF5_ENABLE_FORMATTERS option will enable creation of targets using the
        pattern - HDF5_*_SRC_FORMAT - where * corresponds to the source folder
        or tool folder. All sources can be formatted by executing the format target;
        make format

        (ADB - 2020/09/24)

    - CMake option to link the generated Fortran MOD files into the include
      directory.

        The Fortran generation of MOD files by a Fortran compile can produce
        different binary files between SHARED and STATIC compiles with different
        compilers and/or different platforms. Note that it has been found that
        different versions of Fortran compilers will produce incompatible MOD
        files. Currently, CMake will locate these MOD files in subfolders of
        the include directory and add that path to the Fortran library target
        in the CMake config file, which can be used by the CMake find library
        process. For other build systems using the binary from a CMake install,
        a new CMake configuration can be used to copy the pre-chosen version
        of the Fortran MOD files into the install include directory.

        The default will depend on the configuration of
        BUILD_STATIC_LIBS and BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:
            YES                   YES         Default to SHARED
            YES                   NO          Default to STATIC
            NO                    YES         Default to SHARED
            NO                    NO          Default to SHARED
        The defaults can be overridden by setting the config option
            HDF5_INSTALL_MOD_FORTRAN to one of NO, SHARED, or STATIC

        (ADB - 2020/07/09, HDFFV-11116)

    - CMake option to use AEC (open source SZip) library instead of SZip

        The open source AEC library is a replacement library for SZip. In
        order to use it for hdf5 the libaec CMake source was changed to add
        "-fPIC" and exclude test files. Autotools does not build the
        compression libraries within hdf5 builds. New option USE_LIBAEC is
        required to compensate for the different files produced by AEC build.

        (ADB - 2020/04/22, OESS-65)

    - CMake ConfigureChecks.cmake file now uses CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER

        Some handcrafted tests in HDFTests.c has been removed and the CMake
        CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER module has been used.

        (ADB - 2020/03/24, TRILAB-24)

    - Both build systems use same set of warnings flags

        GNU C, C++ and gfortran warnings flags were moved to files in a config
        sub-folder named gnu-warnings. Flags that only are available for a specific
        version of the compiler are in files named with that version.
        Clang C warnings flags were moved to files in a config sub-folder
        named clang-warnings.
        Intel C, Fortran warnings flags were moved to files in a config sub-folder
        named intel-warnings.

        There are flags in named "error-xxx" files with warnings that may
        be promoted to errors. Some source files may still need fixes.

        There are also pairs of files named "developer-xxx" and "no-developer-xxx"
        that are chosen by the CMake option:HDF5_ENABLE_DEV_WARNINGS or the
        configure option:--enable-developer-warnings.

        In addition, CMake no longer applies these warnings for examples.

        (ADB - 2020/03/24, TRILAB-192)


    Library:
    --------
    - H5Epush_ret() now requires a trailing semicolon

        H5Epush_ret() is a function-like macro that has been changed to
        contain a `do {} while(0)` loop. Consequently, a trailing semicolon
        is now required to end the `while` statement. Previously, a trailing
        semi would work, but was not mandatory. This change was made to allow
        clang-format to correctly format the source code.

        (SAM - 2021/03/03)

    - Improved performance of H5Sget_select_elem_pointlist

        Modified library to cache the point after the last block of points
        retrieved by H5Sget_select_elem_pointlist, so a subsequent call to the
        same function to retrieve the next block of points from the list can
        proceed immediately without needing to iterate over the point list.

        (NAF - 2021/01/19)

    - Added H5VL_VERSION macro that indicates the version of the VOL framework
        implemented by a version of the library.  Currently, compatibility
        checking enforces that the 'version' field in the H5VL_class_t for
        a VOL connector must match the version of the VOL framework for the
        library when it is registered or dynamically loaded.

        (QAK - 2020/12/10)

    - Added two new API routines for tracking library memory use:
        H5get_alloc_stats() and H5get_free_list_sizes().

        (QAK - 2020/03/25)

    Java Library:
    -------------
    - Added new H5S functions.

        H5Sselect_copy, H5Sselect_shape_same, H5Sselect_adjust,
        H5Sselect_intersect_block, H5Sselect_project_intersection,
        H5Scombine_hyperslab, H5Smodify_select, H5Scombine_select
        wrapper functions added.

        (ADB - 2020/10/27, HDFFV-10868)


    Tools:
    ------
    - h5repack added help text for user-defined filters.

        Added help text line that states the valid values of the filter flag
        for user-defined filters;
            filter_flag: 1 is OPTIONAL or 0 is MANDATORY

        (ADB - 2021/01/14, HDFFV-11099)

    - h5repack added options to control how external links are handled.

        Currently h5repack preserves external links and cannot copy and merge
        data from the external files. Two options, merge and prune, were added to
        control how to merge data from an external link into the resulting file.
            --merge             Follow external soft link recursively and merge data.
            --prune             Do not follow external soft links and remove link.
            --merge --prune     Follow external link, merge data and remove dangling link.

        (ADB - 2020/08/05, HDFFV-9984)

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.12.0 release
===================================
    Library
    -------
    - Fixed CVE-2018-17435

        The tool h5dump produced a segfault when the size of a fill value
        message was corrupted and caused a buffer overflow.

        The problem was fixed by verifying the fill value's size
        against the buffer size before attempting to access the buffer.

        (BMR - 2021/03/15, HDFFV-10480)

    - Fixed CVE-2018-14033 (same issue as CVE-2020-10811)

        The tool h5dump produced a segfault when the storage size message
        was corrupted and caused a buffer overflow.

        The problem was fixed by verifying the storage size against the
        buffer size before attempting to access the buffer.

        (BMR - 2021/03/15, HDFFV-11159/HDFFV-11049)

    - Remove underscores on header file guards

        Header file guards used a variety of underscores at the beginning of the define.

        Removed all leading (some trailing) underscores from header file guards.

        (ADB - 2021/03/03, #361)

    - Fixed issue with MPI communicator and info object not being
      copied into new FAPL retrieved from H5F_get_access_plist

        Added logic to copy the MPI communicator and info object into
        the output FAPL. MPI communicator is retrieved from the VFD, while
        the MPI info object is retrieved from the file's original FAPL.

        (JTH - 2021/02/15, HDFFV-11109)

    - Fixed problems with vlens and refs inside compound using
      H5VLget_file_type()

        Modified library to properly ref count H5VL_object_t structs and only
        consider file vlen and reference types to be equal if their files are
        the same.

        (NAF - 2021/01/22)

    - Fix bug and simplify collective metadata write operation when some ranks
        have no entries to contribute.  This fixes parallel regression test
        failures with IBM SpectrumScale MPI on the Summit system at ORNL.

        (QAK - 2020/09/02)

    - Avoid setting up complex MPI types with 0-length vectors, which some
        MPI implementations don't handle well.  (In particular, IBM
        SpectrumScale MPI on the Summit system at ORNL)

        (QAK - 2020/08/21)

    - Explicitly declared dlopen to use RTLD_LOCAL

        dlopen documentation states that if neither RTLD_GLOBAL nor
        RTLD_LOCAL are specified, then the default behavior is unspecified.
        The default on linux is usually RTLD_LOCAL while macos will default
        to RTLD_GLOBAL.

        (ADB - 2020/08/12, HDFFV-11127)

    - H5Sset_extent_none() sets the dataspace class to H5S_NO_CLASS which
      causes asserts/errors when passed to other dataspace API calls.

        H5S_NO_CLASS is an internal class value that should not have been
        exposed via a public API call.

        In debug builds of the library, this can cause assert() function to 
        trip. In non-debug builds, it will produce normal library errors.

        The new library behavior is for H5Sset_extent_none() to convert
        the dataspace into one of type H5S_NULL, which is better handled
        by the library and easier for developers to reason about.

        (DER - 2020/07/27, HDFFV-11027)

    - Fixed the segmentation fault when reading attributes with multiple threads

        It was reported that the reading of attributes with variable length string
        datatype will crash with segmentation fault particularly when the number of
        threads is high (>16 threads).  The problem was due to the file pointer that
        was set in the variable length string datatype for the attribute.  That file
        pointer was already closed when the attribute was accessed.

        The problem was fixed by setting the file pointer to the current opened file pointer
        when the attribute was accessed.  Similar patch up was done before when reading
        dataset with variable length string datatype.

        (VC - 2020/07/13, HDFFV-11080)

    - Reduce overhead for H5open(), which is involved in public symbols like
        H5T_NATIVE_INT, etc.

        (QAK - 2020/06/18)

    - Cache last ID looked up for an ID type (dataset, datatype, file, etc),
        improving performance when accessing the same ID repeatedly.

        (QAK - 2020/06/11)

    - Streamline I/O to a single element, improving performance for record
        appends to chunked datasets.

        (QAK - 2020/06/11)

    - Remove redundant tagging of metadata cache entries for some chunked
        dataset operations, slightly improving performance for chunked
        datasets.

        (QAK - 2020/06/10)

    - Better detect selections with the same shape, improving performance for
        some uses of H5DOappend (and other situations).

        (QAK - 2020/06/07)

    - Don't allocate an empty (0-dimensioned) chunked dataset's chunk
        index, until the dataset's dimensions are increased.

        (QAK - 2020/05/07)


    Java Library
    ------------
    - JNI utility function does not handle new references.

        The JNI utility function for converting reference data to string did
        not use the new APIs. In addition to fixing that function, added new
        java tests for using the new APIs.

        (ADB - 2021/02/16, HDFFV-11212)

    - The H5FArray.java class, in which virtually the entire execution time
        is spent using the HDFNativeData method that converts from an array
        of bytes to an array of the destination Java type.

        1. Convert the entire byte array into a 1-d array of the desired type,
           rather than performing 1 conversion per row;
        2. Use the Java Arrays method copyOfRange to grab the section of the
           array from (1) that is desired to be inserted into the destination array.

        (PGT,ADB - 2020/12/29, HDFFV-10865)


    Configuration
    -------------
    - Reclassify CMake messages, to allow new modes and --log-level option

      CMake message commands have a mode argument. By default, STATUS mode
      was chosen for any non-error message. CMake version 3.15 added additional
      modes, NOTICE, VERBOSE, DEBUG and TRACE. All message commands with a mode
      of STATUS were reviewed and most were reclassified as VERBOSE. The new
      mode was protected by a check for a CMake version of at least 3.15. If CMake
      version 3.17 or above is used, the user can use the command line option
      of "--log-level" to further restrict which message commands are displayed.

      (ADB - 2021/01/11, HDFFV-11144)

    - Fixes Autotools determination of the stat struct having an st_blocks field

      A missing parenthesis in an autoconf macro prevented building the test
      code used to determine if the stat struct contains the st_blocks field.
      Now that the test functions correctly, the H5_HAVE_STAT_ST_BLOCKS #define
      found in H5pubconf.h will be defined correctly on both the Autotools and
      CMake. This #define is only used in the tests and does not affect the
      HDF5 C library.

      (DER - 2021/01/07, HDFFV-11201)


    Tools
    -----
    - Fixed tools argument parsing.

        Tools parsing used the length of the option from the long array to match
        the option from the command line. This incorrectly matched a shorter long
        name option that happened to be a subset of another long option.
        Changed to match whole names.

        (ADB - 2021/01/19, HDFFV-11106)


    Fortran API
    -----------
    - Fixed configure issue when building HDF5 with NAG Fortran 7.0.

        HDF5 now accounts for the addition of half-precision floating-point
        in NAG 7.0 with a KIND=16.

        (MSB - 2020/02/28, HDFFV-11033)


    High-Level Library
    ------------------
    - Eliminated unnecessary code in H5DOappend(), improving its performance.

    Testing
    -------
    - Stopped java/test/junit.sh.in installing libs for testing under ${prefix}

        Lib files needed are now copied to a subdirectory in the java/test
        directory, and on Macs the loader path for libhdf5.xxxs.so is changed
        in the temporary copy of libhdf5_java.dylib.

Known Problems
==============
    CMake files do not behave correctly with paths containing spaces.
    Do not use spaces in paths because the required escaping for handling spaces
    results in very complex and fragile build files.
    ADB - 2019/05/07

    At present, metadata cache images may not be generated by parallel
    applications.  Parallel applications can read files with metadata cache
    images, but since this is a collective operation, a deadlock is possible
    if one or more processes do not participate.

    CPP ptable test fails on both VS2017 and VS2019 with Intel compiler, JIRA
    issue: HDFFV-10628.  This test will pass with VS2015 with Intel compiler.

    Known problems in previous releases can be found in the HISTORY*.txt files
    in the HDF5 source. Please report any new problems found to
    help@hdfgroup.org.


CMake vs. Autotools installations
=================================
While both build systems produce similar results, there are differences.
Each system produces the same set of folders on linux (only CMake works
on standard Windows); bin, include, lib and share. Autotools places the
COPYING and RELEASE.txt file in the root folder, CMake places them in
the share folder.

The bin folder contains the tools and the build scripts. Additionally, CMake
creates dynamic versions of the tools with the suffix "-shared". Autotools
installs one set of tools depending on the "--enable-shared" configuration
option.
  build scripts
  -------------
  Autotools: h5c++, h5cc, h5fc
  CMake: h5c++, h5cc, h5hlc++, h5hlcc

The include folder holds the header files and the fortran mod files. CMake
places the fortran mod files into separate shared and static subfolders,
while Autotools places one set of mod files into the include folder. Because
CMake produces a tools library, the header files for tools will appear in
the include folder.

The lib folder contains the library files, and CMake adds the pkgconfig
subfolder with the hdf5*.pc files used by the bin/build scripts created by
the CMake build. CMake separates the C interface code from the fortran code by
creating C-stub libraries for each Fortran library. In addition, only CMake
installs the tools library. The names of the szip libraries are different
between the build systems.

The share folder will have the most differences because CMake builds include
a number of CMake specific files for support of CMake's find_package and support
for the HDF5 Examples CMake project.

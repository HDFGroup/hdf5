HDF5 version 1.13.3-1 currently under development
================================================================================


INTRODUCTION
============

This document describes the differences between this release and the previous
HDF5 release. It contains information on the platforms tested and known
problems in this release. For more details check the HISTORY*.txt files in the
HDF5 source.

Note that documentation in the links below will be updated at the time of each
final release.

New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    - Update CMake minimum version to 3.18

      Updated CMake minimum version from 3.12 to 3.18 and removed version checks
      which were added for Windows features not yet available in version 3.12. Also
      removed configure macros and code checks for old style code compile checks.

    - Added pointer based H5Dfill_f API

      Added Fortran H5Dfill_f, which is fully equivalent to the C API. It accepts pointers,
      fill value datatype and datatype of dataspace elements.

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.13.2 release
===================================
    Library
    -------
    - Fixed an issue with variable length attributes

      Previously, if a variable length attribute was held open while its file
      was opened through another handle, the same attribute was opened through
      the second file handle, and the second file and attribute handles were
      closed, attempting to write to the attribute through the first handle
      would cause an error.

      (NAF - 2022/10/24)

    - Fixed an issue with hyperslab selections

      Previously, when combining hyperslab selections, it was possible for the
      library to produce an incorrect combined selection.

      (NAF - 2022/09/25)

    - Fixed an issue with attribute type conversion with compound datatypes

      Previously, when performing type conversion for attribute I/O with a
      compound datatype, the library would not fill the background buffer with
      the contents of the destination, potentially causing data to be lost when
      only writing to a subset of the compound fields.

      (NAF - 2022/08/22, GitHub #2016)

    - Memory leak 
    
      A memory leak was observed with variable-length fill value in 
      H5O_fill_convert() function in H5Ofill.c. The leak is
      manifested by running valgrind on test/set_extent.c.

      Previously, fill->buf is used for datatype conversion 
      if it is large enough and the variable-length information 
      is therefore lost.  A buffer is now allocated regardless 
      so that the element in fill->buf can later be reclaimed.

Known Problems
==============
    Setting a variable-length dataset fill value will leak the memory allocated
    for the p field of the hvl_t struct. A fix is in progress for this.
    HDFFV-10840

    CMake files do not behave correctly with paths containing spaces.
    Do not use spaces in paths because the required escaping for handling spaces
    results in very complex and fragile build files.
    ADB - 2019/05/07

    At present, metadata cache images may not be generated by parallel
    applications.  Parallel applications can read files with metadata cache
    images, but since this is a collective operation, a deadlock is possible
    if one or more processes do not participate.

    CPP ptable test fails on both VS2017 and VS2019 with Intel compiler, JIRA
    issue: HDFFV-10628.  This test will pass with VS2015 with Intel compiler.

    The subsetting option in ph5diff currently will fail and should be avoided.
    The subsetting option works correctly in serial h5diff.

    Several tests currently fail on certain platforms:
        MPI_TEST-t_bigio fails with spectrum-mpi on ppc64le platforms.

        MPI_TEST-t_subfiling_vfd and MPI_TEST_EXAMPLES-ph5_subfiling fail with
        cray-mpich on theta and with XL compilers on ppc64le platforms.

        MPI_TEST_testphdf5_tldsc fails with cray-mpich 7.7 on cori and theta.

    Known problems in previous releases can be found in the HISTORY*.txt files
    in the HDF5 source. Please report any new problems found to
    help@hdfgroup.org.


CMake vs. Autotools installations
=================================
While both build systems produce similar results, there are differences.
Each system produces the same set of folders on linux (only CMake works
on standard Windows); bin, include, lib and share. Autotools places the
COPYING and RELEASE.txt file in the root folder, CMake places them in
the share folder.

The bin folder contains the tools and the build scripts. Additionally, CMake
creates dynamic versions of the tools with the suffix "-shared". Autotools
installs one set of tools depending on the "--enable-shared" configuration
option.
  build scripts
  -------------
  Autotools: h5c++, h5cc, h5fc
  CMake: h5c++, h5cc, h5hlc++, h5hlcc

The include folder holds the header files and the fortran mod files. CMake
places the fortran mod files into separate shared and static subfolders,
while Autotools places one set of mod files into the include folder. Because
CMake produces a tools library, the header files for tools will appear in
the include folder.

The lib folder contains the library files, and CMake adds the pkgconfig
subfolder with the hdf5*.pc files used by the bin/build scripts created by
the CMake build. CMake separates the C interface code from the fortran code by
creating C-stub libraries for each Fortran library. In addition, only CMake
installs the tools library. The names of the szip libraries are different
between the build systems.

The share folder will have the most differences because CMake builds include
a number of CMake specific files for support of CMake's find_package and support
for the HDF5 Examples CMake project.

The issues with the gif tool are:
    HDFFV-10592 CVE-2018-17433
    HDFFV-10593 CVE-2018-17436
    HDFFV-11048 CVE-2020-10809
These CVE issues have not yet been addressed and can be avoided by not building
the gif tool. Disable building the High-Level tools with these options:
    autotools:   --disable-hltools
    cmake:       HDF5_BUILD_HL_TOOLS=OFF

Instructions for Building the HDF5 Library, Tests, and Tools 
with the Metrowerks Code Warrior Compiler
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


As of Release 1.4.2, the HDF5 library is supported under the Metrowerks 
Code Warrior 6.0 compiler.

The Code Warrior port of the HDF5 library has been tested only on the
Windows NT platform.

These instructions assume a basic knowledge of the Code Warrior compiler.

To install the HDF5 library:
1. Open the project file hdf5.mcp (located in hdf5\proj\codewarrior\).
2. To build the library:
	Select the 'hdf5' target and build (menu Projects-> Make or F7 key).
3. To build all the targets (HDF5 library, test, and tools):
	Select the 'all' target and build.
4. To run the tests in a command line window:

	In the command line window, change directory to hdf5\test\
	Type 
	    Hdf5test debug
	or, to redirect the output to a file called myfile.txt,
	    Hdf5test debug > myfile.txt
        Type 
            hdf5timingtest debug
        Change directory to hdf5\tools\
        Type
            dumptest debug

   The test and tools files are generated in the same directory as 
   the those compiled with the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler.

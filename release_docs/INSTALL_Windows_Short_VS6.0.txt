HDF5 Build and Install Instructions for Windows XP (Short Version)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This short instruction is written for users who want to quickly
      build HDF5 library and tools from the HDF5 source code package
      but do not want to know HDF5 building and installation details
      on Windows XP.  This is written for the Microsoft Visual
      Studio .NET compiler.
         
      For detailed HDF5 build and install information, or if you have
      trouble following any steps in the instructions, please refer to
      INSTALL_Windows.txt for further information.
      
      We no longer support building the HDF5 package from the
      command line, for test and install using the command line please refer to
      INSATLL_Windows_From_Command_Line.txt.
        
***************************WARNINGS*************************************
Please read CAREFULLY about HDF5 build and install preconditions and 
notes in INSTALL_Windows.txt before starting below procedures.
************************************************************************

STEP 1: Building HDF5 Libraries and Tools
    
1. Unpack all.zip
    
   Unpack windows\all.zip in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\ directory.  If
   prompted to overwrite files, select "Yes to All".

2. Open all.dsw workspace
    
   Open the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\all\all.dsw workspace. 

3. (Optional) Add C++ and/or FORTRAN related projects
    
   3.1 Add the following projects to project "all" dependencies 
       ONLY if you want to build HDF5 C++ libraries
        
          dsets_cpp
          dsets_cppdll
          hdf5_cpp
          hdf5_cppdll
          testhdf5_cpp
          testhdf5_cppdll

   3.2 Add the follwing projects to project "all" dependencies 
       ONLY if you want to build HDF5 FORTRAN libraries
              
          flush1_fortran
          flush1_fortrandll
          flush2_fortran
          flush2_fortrandll
          hdf5_f90cstub
          hdf5_f90cstubdll
          hdf5_fortran
          hdf5_fortrandll
          libtest_cstubdll
          libtest_fortran
          libtest_fortrandll
          testhdf5_fortran
          testhdf5_fortrandll
         
4. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

   In "Project configurations", select the active configuration

	    "all -- Win32 Debug"
               
               or

	    "all -- Win32 Release"
	        
   Then build project "all".


STEP 2: Testing HDF5 Libraries and Tools 

HDF5 libraries and tools should be tested to make sure that they were
built correctly.

HDF5 libraries and tools can be tested with hdf5check.bat batch file 
in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.

The following options are supported:
   
   hdf5check                     test HDF5 C library and tools only
      
   hdf5check enablecpp           test HDF5 C/C++ libraries and tools
            

Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with appropriate
options.

Test results are saved in two files:

   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt   

   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt.

In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If all the
tests passed, then you do not have to check check_results.txt.  
If some tests failed, check check_results.txt can help you
figure out what was wrong.

If you want to test HDF5 libraries and tools one by one, please refer to
section II, step 2 in INSTALL_Windows.txt.


STEP 3: Installing HDF5 Libraries

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\installhdf5lib.bat to install 
all HDF5 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib directory.


STEP 4: Building HDF5 Examples (Optional)

Please read section II, step 4 in INSTALL_Windows.txt.

     HDF5 Fortran90 Library Build and Testing Instructions for Windows NNT/2000
     with DEC Visual Fortran V6.0 and Intel compilers.
===============================================================================


Preconditions

    1. These instructions are for users who wish to build the C and 
       Fortran90 libraries.  If you are interested only in the C library, 
       see INSTAll_Windows.txt or INSTAll_codewarrior.txt.

    2. MSVC++ V 6.0, DEC Visual Fortran V6.0, or Intel C and Fortran compilers,
       and WinZip must be installed prior to building the HDF5 library.  

    3. Download the hdf5-1.*.* distribution archive and run WinZip to unpack 
       the source code.  The code will be unpacked into the hdf5-1.*.*\ directory.
       (*.* stands for the minor release and revision number). Rename the
       unpacked directory to hdf5.

    4. GNU zlib and szlib library should be installed on the machine. You may
       find prebuilt binaries on the HDF ftp site (see gzip/bin and szip/bin
       directories on the HDF FTP server ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/)
       If you wish not to use zlib and/or szlib libraries, see Section V in the 
       INSTALL_Windows.txt how to disable external filters.
Note:
    Only static libraries are built for this release.

Building the HDF5 Fortran and C libraries : 

    1. Unpack all_withf90.zip, found in the hdf5\ directory, into the 
       hdf5\ directory.
    2. Go to the hdf5\proj\ directory and click on the file all.dsw. 
       This will invoke MS VC++.
    3. Set up library and include directories to point to zlib and szlib
       libraries on your system. Go to Tools-->Options-->Directories
       Select "Include files" or "Library files" in the "Show directories for" tab.
       Add corresponding directories for zlib and szlib include files and libraries. 
       This step is not needed if you disabled external filters in step 4 above.
    3".  Skip this step if you are not using Intel compilers
         Go to Tools-->Select Compiler
         Check Intel box and click OK button.
         Go to Tools-->Customize-->Add-ins and Macro Files
         and check Intel Fortran Compiler Build Tool
     
    4. Select "Build", then select "Set Active Configuration".

            "all -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of
                single-threaded static libraries and tests. 

            "all -- Win32 Release" to build release versions of
                single-threaded static libraries and tests.

    When the debug or release build is completed, the directories 
    listed below will contain the following files:

           hdf5\proj\hdf5\debug - 
           hdf5\proj\hdf5\release - 
               hdf5.lib- the F90 and C hdf5 libraries


Testing libraries and tools

    1. See the file INSTALL_Windows.txt (STEP 2) for instruction on 
       testing the C HDF5 library and tools.

    2. To test Fortran HDF5 Library, run testhdf5_fortran.bat in the
       hdf5\fortran\test directory

HDF5 Build and Install Instructions for Windows 2000/XP.
----------------------------------------------------------

The instructions which follow assume that you will be using the 
source code release 'zip' file (hdf5-160.zip).

***************************WARNINGS****************************
Please read CAREFULLY about Preconditions before you go to the 
following sections

Preconditions 

   1. Installed MicroSoft Developer Studio,Visual C++ 6.0 and 
      WinZip.

   2. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library. 
      For example:

	    c:\					(any drive)
	   MyHDFstuff\				(any folder name)

   3. Download the hdf5-1.* distribution archive and use WinZip to
      extract the hdf5 package into c:\MyHDFstuff.  This creates a 
      directory called 'hdf5-1.*' under MyHDFstuff which contains
      several files and directories. Rename "hdf5-1.*" to "hdf5".  

   4. HDF5 uses zlib for compression and zlib is NOT distributed 
      with hdf5 lib in 1.6.0 release. You have to install your own
      zlib library or you may go to HDF web site
	(ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/gzip/) 
      to download the correponding zlib library by yourself. If you 
      want to build HDF5 library without using zlib, please read section V.

   5. HDF5 uses szlib(szip) for compression and szlib is distributed with hdf5 lib
      in 1.6.0 release. You can also download szlib source codes and binaries from
      ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/szip/windows/
      If you want to build HDF5 library without using szlib, please read
      section V.

   6. HDF4-related tools are not built and released with HDF5 library
      packages any more. To obtain HDF4-related tools, please check
      http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/h4toh5/ and ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/h4toh5/

   7. For .NET users, please go to section VI.

   8. For DLL users, please do read and follow "DLL hints" at Section IV.

   9. For users who would like to build, test and use HDF5 snapshot release, please
      read Section VII.

Section II: 

  Building and testing hdf5 libraries and non-hdf4 related tools 

      ==================================================

STEP 1: Building hdf5 libraries and non-hdf4 related tools


    1. Extract all.zip under c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\windows  to c:\myHDFstuff'

       The system directory can usually be found under the path 
       C:\WINNT\system or C:\WINDOWS\system
      
    2. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select 
       the "Open Workspace" option. 

       Then open the c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\all\all.dsw 
       workspace. 

    3. Select project hdf5dll, right click mouse; choose settings,
	 find "Link", go to the Category box and choose "Input",
	 go to the box "Object/library modules" and go to the end of the line;
	 check whether the zlib dll library path is correct.
	 If not, replace the old path with the correct path.

	 You should do this for both Debug and release version.

    4. Go to "Tools" and select "Options", find "Directories";
        4.1 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Include files",
            If you cannot find your zlib and szlib header path
            (for example, C:\zlib114\include,C:\szlib\include)
	      from the directory list,
            add them(for example,C:\zlib114\include,C:\szlib\include) to 
            the included directories.
        4.2 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files",
            If you cannot find your zlib and szlib library path
            (for example, C:\zlib114\lib,C:szlib\lib,C:szlib\dll)
	      from the directory list,
            add them(C:\zlib114\lib,C:\szlib\lib,C:\szlib\dll) to the included directories.

    5. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

       On Windows platform select as the active configuration

	   "all -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of
	    single-threaded static libraries, Debug multithreaded
          DLLs and tests. 
                or

	   "all -- Win32 Release" to build release versions of
          single-threaded static libraries, multithreaded DLLs
          and tests.

      
       Warning messages can be ignored. 

       When the debug or release build is done the directories 
       listed below will contain the following files:

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5\debug - 
            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5\release - 

                  hdf5.lib- the hdf5 library

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\debug - 

                  hdf5ddll.dll- the hdf5 library
                  hdf5ddll.lib- the dll export library                  

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\release - 

                  hdf5dll.dll- the hdf5 library
                  hdf5dll.lib- the dll export library

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\test\"test directory"-

                        
		c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslib\debug
	      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslib\release

                  toolslib.lib- the tools library

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslibD\debug
	      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslibD\release

                  toolslibD.lib- the dll export library 

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\"tools directory"-
            where non-hdf4 related tools directory is one of the 
            following:
 
	          h5dump(dll)

                h5ls(dll)

                h5debug(dll)

                h5import(dll)
                    
                h5repart(dll)	            

                gifconv(dll)
		

           Test and tool directory contains debug and release 
           subdirectories with the corresponding tests and tools.


STEP 2:   testing hdf5 libraries and non-hdf4 related tools 

In a command prompt window run the test batch file which resides in 
the hdf5\test directory(for example: C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\test)to make 
sure that the library was built correctly.

You can possibily test four versions of hdf5 library and tools. They are:

	release version
	release dll version
	debug version
	debug dll version

NOTE: 

1) hdf5ddll.dll and hdf5dll.dll should be placed into some place that
the application can find, one suggestion is to use
the C:\WINNT\system or C:\WINDOWS\system directory before using the dlls.

2) If you want to test HDF5 DLL using HDF5 test projects inside HDF5 workspace,
libtestD.dll should also be placed into some place that the application 
can find, one suggestion is to use the C:\WINNT\system or C:\WINDOWS\system
directory before testing HDF5 DLL using HDF5 test projects inside HDF5
workspace.

We strongly suggest you to redirect your testing results into
an output file and you can easily check the testing results. 
You may use either NotePad or WordPad or whatever other
windows tools to check the results. For the purpose of printing, 
please choose font less than 14 for better alignment of the text.

  1. hdf5 library testing 

     cd into the hdf5\test directory. 

        (1) basic tests
            
            Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

            a) release static version
            type:             
               hdf5test release >"Your output filename" 

	      b) release dll version
            type:
               hdf5test release dll > "Your output filename"
				
            c) debug static version
            type: 
               hdf5test debug >"Your output filename"

            d) debug dll version
            type:
               hdf5test debug dll >"Your output filename"
            
        (2) timing tests

            Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

            a) release static version
            type:             
               hdf5timingtest release >"Your output filename" 

	      b) release dll version
            type:
             hdf5timingtest release dll >"Your output filename"
				
            c) debug static version
            type: 
               hdf5timingtest debug >"Your output filename"

            d) debug dll version
            type:
               hdf5timingtest debug dll >"Your output filename"


     Use notepad or wordpad to check results. You should 
not find any FAILED marks in your output files.

  Note: big test is currently not working for windows because it needs
to allocate more space, however, HDF5 can support more than 4GB
file if you are using NTFS. We still investigate the possibility to support 
this test.
 
 2. hdf5 tools testing
 
    Currently we are only supporting h5dump test. We are 
investigating h5ls test now. 
    
    1) h5dump test

    cd back into hdf5 directory and then cd into tools
directory(...\hdf5\tools)

    Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

        a) release static version
        type:             
           dumptest release >"Your output filename" 

	  b) release dll version
        type:
           dumptest release dll > "Your output filename"
				
        c) debug static version
        type: 
           dumptest debug >"Your output filename"

        d) debug dll version
        type:
           dumptest debug dll >"Your output filename"
   

    We are using "fc" command to compare whether dumper 
generates correct results. Supposedly you should find 
"FC: no differences encountered" in your output file. 
However, since we are comparing the actual dumper output
with the expected dumper output under different directory, 
you may see something like:

"
***** ..\TESTFILES\tall-1.ddl
#############################
Expected output for 'h5dump tall.h5'
#############################
HDF5 "tall.h5" {
GROUP "/" {
***** TALL-1.RESULTS
HDF5 "..\..\testfiles\tall.h5" {
GROUP "/" {
*****
"

   The actual dumper output is correct. The difference showing 
here is the different representations of filename of the same 
file.

STEP 3: BUILDING THE EXAMPLES

    1. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select
       the "Open Workspace" option. 
       Then open the workspace
       c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\allexamples\allexamples.dsw.

    2. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

       On Windows platform select as the active configuration

	   "allexamples -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions 
          of the examples.

                or
	
	   "allexamples -- Win32 Release" to build release 
          versions the examples.

          When the debug build or release build is done 
          there should be the following subdirectories in 
          C:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\

			attributetest
 
			chunkread

			compoundtest 

			extendwritetest 

			grouptest 

			readtest 

			selecttest 

			writetest 



    3. Run the batch file "InstallExamples.bat" which 
       resides in the top level directory(C:\MyHDFSTUFF\hdf5).
       This file creates 2 new directories,examplesREL and 
       examplesDBG,in the examples directory and places
       all the executables in it. Both the release and debug
       versions of the examples should be built before this 
       step is done. The examples should be tested in these 2 
       new directories due to some dependencies between the 
       examples. Especially writetest.exe and extendwritetest.exe 
       should be executed before chunkread.exe and readtest.exe 
       due to dependencies among these files.

Section III:  
BUILDING AN APPLICATION USING THE HDF5 LIBRARY OR DLL- SOME HELPFUL 
POINTERS
====================================================================

If you are building an application that uses the HDF5 library the
following locations will need to be specified for locating header files
and linking in the HDF libraries:

            <top-level HDF5 directory>\src

where <top-level HDF5 directory> may be 

            C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\

To specify this location in the settings for your VC++ project, you may choose 
one of the following two methods.

   1) 
    To insert the path that specifics HDF5 and zlib,szlib header files:

    1. Open your VC project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it is
       the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the 'Settings' option.

    3. Chose the build configuration you would like to modify in the
       drop down menu labeled with 'Settings For:'

    4. Chose the C/C++ tab

    5. At the bottom of the window, there should be a text-area labeled
       with 'Project Options:'. In this text-area, scroll until you
       reach the end and type /I "<top-level HDF5 directory>\src" and
       then click OK.

   
    To link the HDF5 library with your application:

    1. Open your VC project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it is
       the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the 'Add to Project' option and
       then 'Files' option.

    3. Change the 'Files of type:' to 'Library Files (.lib)'

    4. Navigate through the directories until you find the location of 
       the hdf5.lib. 

    5. Select hdf5.lib and click OK.

    6. repeat 1-5, to select zlib.lib and szlib.lib.

  2) 

	Go to tools/options/directories,

	1. Insert the correct HDF5,zlib,szlib paths for both headers(include) and libraries.
      2. Go to the Project menu and choose the 'Settings' option.
      3. Find the "link" option and "Input" category, insert "zlib.lib, szlib.lib, hdf5.lib".



To use the DLL:

    1. Follow the steps for specifing the location of the header files
       as shown above.

    2. Follow the steps for linking the HDF5 library as shown above
       except now link the export library that is created with the DLL.
       The export library is called hdf5dll.lib or hdf5ddll.lib for
       debug version.

    3. Place the DLL in a location that Windows will be able to locate 
       it. The searched path and order for DLL's is

       a) The directory where the executable module for the current
          process is located.
       b) The current directory. 
       c} The Windows system directory. The GetSystemDirectory function 
          retrieves the path of this directory. 
       d) The Windows directory. The GetWindowsDirectory function
          retrieves the path of this directory.
       e) The directories listed in the PATH environment variable. 
    4. To modify your own application settings, please DO FOLLOW th "DLL Hints" 
	at section IV "MORE HELPFUL POINTERS".


Section IV:
MORE HELPFUL POINTERS
=====================


Here are some notes that may be of help if you are not familiar with
using the Visual C++ Development Environment.

Project name and location issues: 
       
    The files in all.zip must end up in the hdf5\ directory installed by
    hdf5-1_6_0.zip

    If you must install all.dsw and all.dsp in another directory,
    relative to hdf5\ , you will be asked to locate the sub-project
    files, when you open the project all.dsw.

    If you want to rename all (the entire project), you will need to
    modify two files all.dsw and all.dsp as text (contrary to the
    explicit warnings in the files).

    You can also modify all.dsw and all.dsp as text, to allow these 2
    files to be installed in another directory.

  
Settings... details:

    If you create your own project, the necessary settings can be read
    from the all.dsp file(as text), or from the Project Settings in the
    Developer Studio project settings dialog.

    Project
	  Settings
	      C/C++
		  Category
		     PreProcessor
			 Code Generation
			    Use run-time Library
				   These are all set to use 
                                      Single-Threaded

DLL... hints:
  
   If you want to use DLL versions of hdf5 library in your application, 
   you should  
      1) put hdf5 DLL into windows system directory
      2) add hdf5 DLL export library into your project
      3) Follow "Settings... details" into the last line:
         change Single-Threaded into Multithreaded DLL or 
         Debug Multithreaded DLL
      4) Follow "Settings.. details" into PreProcessor:
         Project
	       Settings
	           C/C++
		       Category
		          PreProcessor

         Find PreProcessor definations and Add _HDF5USEDLL_ at the
         end of the PreProcessor definations
         



Section V:

Disable gzip compression 
============================================

If you would like to remove gzip compression from the hdf5 library  
follow the steps below.


    1) Open the H5pubconf.h file from the src directory and remove(or comment
       out) the following two lines:

		#define H5_HAVE_ZLIB_H 1
		#define H5_HAVE_FILTER_DEFLATE 1

    then save the file.
	
    2) run-compile HDF5 library according to the previous steps.

Diable szip compression
=============================================
If you would like to remove szip compression from the hdf5 library  
follow the steps below.


    1) Open the H5pubconf.h file from the src directory and remove(or comment
       out) the following two lines: 

		#define H5_HAVE_SZLIB_H 1
		#define H5_HAVE_FILTER_SZIP 1

    then save the file.
	
    2) run-compile HDF5 library according to the previous steps.


Section VI:

How to build HDF5 in VS 7.0(.NET)    
============================================
We just briefly introduce you how to build HDF5 in VS 7.0(.NET);

1. Open the old dataspace file with the "Open solution" option,
.NET will automatically convert the data space file to solution file.
2. Then find  "Build" and go to "Configuration Manager"; choose "release"
or "debug", then choose "build all".
3. If you want to change some project setting, select the project and right
click the button to choose Properties; find the similar menu there as in 6.0.
4. You need to specify the zlib include header files and libraries under 
Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories and choose Include and libraries under
the category of "show directories for" to add the corresponding path.

Note: Currently we only build and test .NET on windows XP.

Section VII:

Build and test HDF5 snapshot release

Note: This section is only for users who would like to build and test HDF5 snapshot release.

If you want to test and build HDF5 snapshot release, you need extra steps to automatically
generate H5Tinit.c before going to section II step 1(2).

Previous step: section II, step 1(1).
Extra steps:
1) After extracting all.zip to the correct path, open the 
	c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\misc\typegen\typegen.dsw.
2) Build the project file.
3) Invoke command prompt and go to c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\src.
4) type H5Tinit.exe >H5Tinit.c
5) Go back to section II, continue with step 1(2).

Section VIII:

Misc.

1) drivers we support
The default driver on windows we support is sec2 driver. However, stdio driver
is also supported. If you want to use stdio driver in your application, you
may set environment variable HDF5_DRIVER to "stdio".

On windows 2000, the following steps should be followed to set environment
variable,

 a) Go to Control panel and find "system",
 b) Click "system" and choose "advanced",
 c) Choose Environment Variables
 d) Add new variable "HDF5_DRIVER"
 e) set the "HDF5_DRIVER" to "stdio"

Reminder: if you don't want to use stdio driver, please remember to delete
the environment variable "HDF5_DRIVER" or change the variable value to "sec2".

Please send email to hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu for further assistance.

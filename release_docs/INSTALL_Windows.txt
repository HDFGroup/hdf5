HDF5 Build and Install Instructions for Windows 2000/NT.
----------------------------------------------------------

The instructions which follow assume that you will be using the 
source code release 'zip' file (hdf5-1_4_4.zip).

***************************WARNINGS****************************
Please read CAREFULLY about Preconditions before you go to the 
following sections

Preconditions 

   1. Installed MicroSoft Developer Studio,Visual C++ 6.0 and 
      WinZip.

   2. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library. 
      For example:

	    c:\					(any drive)
	   MyHDFstuff\				(any folder name)

   3. Run WinZip on hdf5-1_4_4.zip (the entire source tree) and
      extract hdf5 package into c:\MyHDFstuff(or whatever drive 
      and folder name you would like to choose). This creates a 
      directory called 'hdf5xxx'under MyHDFstuff which contains 
      several files and directories. Rename directory "hdf5xxx"
      into "hdf5".

   4. HDF5 uses zlib for compression and zlib is NOT distributed 
      with hdf5 lib in 1.4.4 release. You have to install your own
      zlib library or you may go to HDF web site(ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/gzip/) 
      to download
      the correponding zlib library by yourself. If you want to build
      HDF5 library without using zlib, please read section V.

   5. HDF4-related tools are not built and released with HDF5 library
      packages any more. To obtain HDF4-related tools, please check
      http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/h4toh5/ and ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/h4toh5/

Section II: 

  Building and testing hdf5 libraries and non-hdf4 related tools 

      ==================================================

STEP 1: Building hdf5 libraries and non-hdf4 related tools


      
    1. Make sure you have your own zlib library(both dll and static)
       stored at your machine. In this document we will use
       c:\zlib114 to represent the top directory of your zlib library.

       Make sure that zlib.dll has been moved to the system directory
       C:\WINNT\system
 

    2. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select 
       the "Open Workspace" option. 

       Then open the c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\all\all.dsw 
       workspace. 

    3. Select project hdf5dll, right click mouse; choose settings,
       find "Link", go to the Category box and choose "Input",
       go to the box "Object/library modules" and go to the end of the line;
       see whether the zlib dll library path is the same as C:\zlib114\dll
       or the correct path where you install your dll export library.
       If not, replace the old zlib dll library path with the correct path.

       You should do this for both Debug and release version.
    4. Go to "Tools" and select "Options", find "Directories";
        4.1 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Include files",
            If you cannot find C:\zlib114\include at the directory listed,
            add C:\zlib114\include to the included directories.
        4.2 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files",
            If you cannot find C:\zlib114\lib at the directory listed,
            add C:\zlib114\lib to the included directories.

    5. If you don't want to build and test backward 
       compatibility with hdf5 1.2, you may skip this part and
       go to part 6.

       To build and test backward compatibility with hdf5 1.2, 
           a) go to "Project" and select "Settings"
           b) A window called "Project Settings" should be 
              popped up,on the upper-left corner is a small box 
              "Settings For". Set the option to 
              "Win32 Release".
           c) Go to the the right side of "Project Settings" 
              window,choose C/C++ on the menu.
           d) Go to the "Category" box below menu bar, choose 
              Preprocessor.
           e) Go to "Preprocessor definitions" box below   
              "Category". Inside the box, type 
              "WANT_H5_V1_2_COMPAT". Note: don't type double 
              quote for "WANT_H5_V1_2_COMPAT" and add a comma
              between "WANT_H5_V1_2_COMPAT" and the last 
              preprocessor definations(WIN32).
           f) click OK at the bottom of "Project Settings" 
              window.
           g) repeat a)-f) and choose the option as 
              "win32 Debug" on step b).
             
    6. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

       On Windows platform select as the active configuration

	   "all -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of
	    single-threaded static libraries, Debug multithreaded
          DLLs and tests. 
                or

	   "all -- Win32 Release" to build release versions of
          single-threaded static libraries, multithreaded DLLs
          and tests.


       When the debug or release build is done the directories 
       listed below will contain the following files:

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5\debug - 
            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5\release - 

                  hdf5.lib- the hdf5 library

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\debug - 

                  hdf5ddll.dll- the hdf5 library
                  hdf5ddll.lib- the dll export library                  

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\release - 

                  hdf5dll.dll- the hdf5 library
                  hdf5dll.lib- the dll export library

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\test\"test directory"-

            where test directory is one of the following:

			big(dll)

			bittests(dll)

			chunk(dll)

			cmpd_dset(dll)

			dsets(dll)

			dtypes(dll)
			
			enum(dll)

			extend(dll)

			external(dll)

			fillval(dll)

			flush1(dll)

			flush2(dll)

			gheap(dll)

			hyperslab(dll)

			iopipe(dll)

			istore(dll)

			links(dll)

			mount(dll) 

			mtime(dll)

			ohdr(dll)

			overhead(dll)

			stab(dll)

			testhdf5(dll) 

			unlink(dll)

            
		c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslib\debug
	      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslib\release

                  toolslib.lib- the tools library

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslibD\debug
	      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslibD\release

                  toolslibD.lib- the dll export library 

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\"tools directory"-
            where non-hdf4 related tools directory is one of the 
            following:
 
	          h5dump(dll)

                  h5ls(dll)

                  h5debug(dll)

                  h5import(dll)
                    
                  h5repart(dll)	            
		

           Test and tool directory contains debug and release 
           subdirectories with the corresponding tests and tools.


STEP 2:   testing hdf5 libraries and non-hdf4 related tools 

In a command prompt window run the test batch file which resides in 
the hdf5\test directory(for example: C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\test)to make 
sure that the library was built correctly.

You can possibily test four versions of hdf5 library and tools. They are:

	release version
	release dll version
	debug version
	debug dll version

NOTE: The hdf5ddll.dll and hdf5dll.dll should be placed into
the C:\WINNT\system or C:\WINDOWS\system directory before using the dlls.

We strongly suggest you to redirect your testing results into
an output file and you can easily check the testing results. 
You may use either NotePad or NoteTab Light or whatever other
windows tools to check the results. For the purpose of printing, 
please choose font less than 14 for better alignment of the text.

  1. hdf5 library testing 

     cd into the hdf5\test directory. 

        (1) basic tests
            
            Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

            a) release static version
            type:             
               hdf5test release >"Your output filename" 

	      b) release dll version
            type:
               hdf5test release dll > "Your output filename"
				
            c) debug static version
            type: 
               hdf5test debug >"Your output filename"

            d) debug dll version
            type:
               hdf5test debug dll >"Your output filename"
            
        (2) timing tests

            Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

            a) release static version
            type:             
               hdf5timingtest release >"Your output filename" 

	      b) release dll version
            type:
             hdf5timingtest release dll >"Your output filename"
				
            c) debug static version
            type: 
               hdf5timingtest debug >"Your output filename"

            d) debug dll version
            type:
               hdf5timingtest debug dll >"Your output filename"


     Use notepad or notetab light to check results. You should 
not find any FAILED marks in your output files.

  Note: big test is currently not working for windows, we are 
still investigating this.
 
 2. hdf5 tools testing
 
    Currently we are only supporting h5dump test. We are 
investigating h5ls test now. 
    
    1) h5dump test

    cd back into hdf5 directory and then cd into tools
directory(...\hdf5\tools)

    Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

        a) release static version
        type:             
           dumptest release >"Your output filename" 

	  b) release dll version
        type:
           dumptest release dll > "Your output filename"
				
        c) debug static version
        type: 
           dumptest debug >"Your output filename"

        d) debug dll version
        type:
           dumptest debug dll >"Your output filename"
   

    We are using "fc" command to compare whether dumper 
generates correct results. Supposedly you should find 
"FC: no differences encountered" in your output file. 
However, since we are comparing the actual dumper output
with the expected dumper output under different directory, 
you may see something like:

"
***** ..\TESTFILES\tall-1.ddl
#############################
Expected output for 'h5dump tall.h5'
#############################
HDF5 "tall.h5" {
GROUP "/" {
***** TALL-1.RESULTS
HDF5 "..\..\testfiles\tall.h5" {
GROUP "/" {
*****
"

   The actual dumper output is correct. The difference showing 
here is the different representations of filename of the same 
file.

STEP 3: BUILDING THE EXAMPLES

    1. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select
       the "Open Workspace" option. 
       Then open the workspace
       c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\allexamples\allexamples.dsw.

    2. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

       On Windows platform select as the active configuration

	   "allexamples -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions 
          of the examples.

                or
	
	   "allexamples -- Win32 Release" to build release 
          versions the examples.

          When the debug build or release build is done 
          there should be the following subdirectories in 
          C:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\

			attributetest
 
			chunkread

			compoundtest 

			extendwritetest 

			grouptest 

			readtest 

			selecttest 

			writetest 



    3. Run the batch file "InstallExamples.bat" which 
       resides in the top level directory(C:\MyHDFSTUFF\hdf5).
       This file creates 2 new directories,examplesREL and 
       examplesDBG,in the examples directory and places
       all the executables in it. Both the release and debug
       versions of the examples should be built before this 
       step is done. The examples should be tested in these 2 
       new directories due to some dependencies between the 
       examples. Especially writetest.exe and extendwritetest.exe 
       should be executed before chunkread.exe and readtest.exe 
       due to dependencies among these files.

Section III:  
BUILDING AN APPLICATION USING THE HDF5 LIBRARY OR DLL- SOME HELPFUL 
POINTERS
====================================================================

If you are building an application that uses the HDF5 library the
following locations will need to be specified for locating header files
and linking in the HDF libraries:

            <top-level HDF5 directory>\src

where <top-level HDF5 directory> may be 

            C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\

To specify this location in the settings for your VC++ project:

    1. Open your VC project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it is
       the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the 'Settings' option.

    3. Chose the build configuration you would like to modify in the
       drop down menu labeled with 'Settings For:'

    4. Chose the C/C++ tab

    5. At the bottom of the window, there should be a text-area labeled
       with 'Project Options:'. In this text-area, scroll until you
       reach the end and type /I "<top-level HDF5 directory>\src" and
       then click OK.

To link the HDF5 library with your application:

    1. Open your VC project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it is
       the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the 'Add to Project' option and
       then 'Files' option.

    3. Change the 'Files of type:' to 'Library Files (.lib)'

    4. Navigate through the directories until you find the location of 
       the hdf5.lib. 

    5. Select hdf5.lib and click OK.


To use the DLL:

    1. Follow the steps for specifing the location of the header files
       as shown above.

    2. Follow the steps for linking the HDF5 library as shown above
       except now link the export library that is created with the DLL.
       The export library is called hdf5dll.lib or hdf5ddll.lib for
       debug version.

    3. Place the DLL in a location that Windows will be able to locate 
       it. The search path and order for DLL's is

       a) The directory where the executable module for the current
          process is located.
       b) The current directory. 
       c} The Windows system directory. The GetSystemDirectory function 
          retrieves the path of this directory. 
       d) The Windows directory. The GetWindowsDirectory function
          retrieves the path of this directory.
       e) The directories listed in the PATH environment variable. 


Section IV:
MORE HELPFUL POINTERS
=====================


Here are some notes that may be of help if you are not familiar with
using the Visual C++ Development Environment.

Project name and location issues: 
       
    The files in all.zip must end up in the hdf5\ directory installed by
    hdf5-1_4_4.zip

    If you must install all.dsw and all.dsp in another directory,
    relative to hdf5\ , you will be asked to locate the sub-project
    files, when you open the project all.dsw.

    If you want to rename all (the entire project), you will need to
    modify two files all.dsw and all.dsp as text (contrary to the
    explicit warnings in the files).

    You can also modify all.dsw and all.dsp as text, to allow these 2
    files to be installed in another directory.

  
Settings... details:

    If you create your own project, the necessary settings can be read
    from the all.dsp file(as text), or from the Project Settings in the
    Developer Studio project settings dialog.

    Project
	  Settings
	      C/C++
		  Category
		     PreProcessor
			 Code Generation
			    Use run-time Library
				   These are all set to use 
                                      Single-Threaded

DLL... hints:
  
   If you want to use DLL versions of hdf5 library in your application, 
   you should  
      1) put hdf5 DLL into windows system directory
      2) add hdf5 DLL export library into your project
      3) Follow "Settings... details" into the last line:
         change Single-Threaded into Multithreaded DLL or 
         Debug Multithreaded DLL
      4) Follow "Settings.. details" into PreProcessor:
         Project
	       Settings
	           C/C++
		       Category
		          PreProcessor

         Find PreProcessor definations and Add _HDF5USEDLL_ at the
         end of the PreProcessor definations
         



Section V:
Disable gzip compression 
============================================

If you would like to gzip compression from the hdf5 library  
follow the steps below.


    1) Open the H5pubconf.h file from the src directory and remove the 
    following two lines:

		#define H5_HAVE_LIBZ 1
		#define H5_HAVE_COMPRESS2

    then save the file.
	
    2) run-compile HDF5 library according to the previous steps.

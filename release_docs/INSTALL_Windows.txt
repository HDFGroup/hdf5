HDF5 Build and Install Instructions for Windows 2000/XP (Full Version)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following instructions assume that the HDF5 source code package 
from HDF website (http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu) is used.


***************************WARNINGS***********************************
Please read CAREFULLY about the following preconditions and notes first.

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. Installed Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or Intel C compiler and WinZip.
       
      1.1 Installed DEC Visual Fortran compiler(6.0 or higher version), 
          or Intel Fortran compiler if you want to build HDF5 Fortran
          libraries.    

      Note: By default, WinZip will convert the Unix end of line format
            when extracting .tar file.  This conversion will cause
            "false" failure in some HDF5 tools testings.
 
            Please uncheck the "TAR file smart CR/LF conversion" option
            in your WinZip to prevent the conversion when extracting
            .tar file.

            To uncheck the "TAR file smart CR/LF conversion" option:

            Invoke WinZip, go to "Options", select "Configuration..."

            Click the "Miscellaneous" tab and uncheck "TAR file smart
            CR/LF conversion" option, then click OK.

   2. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library.  For example:

	        c:\                              (any drive)
	        MyHDFstuff\                      (any folder name)

   3. Download the hdf5-1.6.x source code package and use WinZip to 
      extract the HDF5 package into c:\MyHDFstuff.  This creates a 
      directory called 'hdf5-1.6.x' under MyHDFstuff which contains 
      several files and directories.  Rename "hdf5-1.6.x" to "hdf5".  

   4. HDF5 provide options to do in-memory compress within HDF5
      library.  Currently, two external compression libraries Zlib and
      Szip can be used with HDF5.

      4.1 HDF5 uses Zlib version 1.2.2 for compression and Zlib is NOT
          distributed with HDF5 library in 1.6.x release. To use Zlib
          library, you have to install your own Zlib DLL library or go
          to ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/lib-external/zlib/1.2/bin 
          to download the Zlib library.
      
      4.2 HDF5 uses Szip version 2.0 for compression and Szip
          compression software is provided with HDF5 products starting
          from 1.6.0 release.  To use Szip 2.0 library, you can
          download Szip source codes and binaries from
          ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/lib-external/szip/2.0/bin/windows

          Please note that Szip is not a totally open-source free
          software.  For licensing issue of Szip, please check 
          "Licensing terms" at
          http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/index.html.

      Compression feature inside HDF5 is optional. 
      
   5. Define the following environment variables: 

        HDF5_EXT_ZLIB
        HDF5_EXT_SZIP
      
      In this section, Zlib and Szip compression software are assumed
      to be used.  Please read section V as well as this section if you
      do not want to use compression feature inside HDF5.
      
      To define these environment variables:
      
      Click "Start", click "Control Panel", and then double-click
      "System".  On the "Advanced" tab, click "Environment Variables".
      
      If you are logged on as administrator to the local computer AND
      want to let all other users use these two environment variables,
      click "New" under "System Variables" box; otherwise, click "New"
      under "User Variables" box.
      
      In the New Variable window, set "Variable name" as HDF5_EXT_ZLIB
      and "Variable value" as zdll.lib, then click OK.
      
      Similarly, you can set:

      HDF5_EXT_SZIP environment variable as szlibdll.lib

      Notes:

         a. You might have to close and reopen running programs for
            the new environment variable settings to take effect. 

         b. c:\zlib122\zlib1.dll and c:\szip\dll\szlibdll.dll should
            be copied into the location that the application can find,
            one suggestion is to use the c:\WINNT\system or
            c:\WINDOWS\system
      
   6. Set up path for external libraries and headers
    
      Skip this part if you don't want to use ANY compression feature
      provided by HDF5.  Please do read section V.

      You have to read this part even if you want to only use Zlib
      or Szip.  You also need to read section V.

      Invoke Microsoft Visual C++ and go to "Tools" and select
      "Options", find "Directories";
      
      6.1 Find the box "Show directories for", choose 
          "Include files",
          If you cannot find your Zlib and Szip header path
          (for example, c:\zlib122\include, c:\szip\include)
          from the directory list, add the header path
          (c:\zlib122\include, c:\szip\include) to the 
          included directories.
      
      6.2 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files",
          If you cannot find your Zlib and Szip library path
          (for example, c:\zlib122\lib, c:\szip\dll)
          from the directory list, add the library path
          (c:\zlib122\lib, c:\szip\dll) to the library directories.

Section II: How to build and test HDF5 libraries and tools 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    STEP 1: Building HDF5 libraries and tools
    =========================================

      1. Unpack all.zip
    
      Unpack all.zip in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows directory.  Files in 
      all.zip has path hdf5\....  Make sure that you extract files into
      the c:\MyHDFstuff directory. 

      2. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
    
      Invoke Microsoft Visual C++.  From the main menu, go to "File"
      and select the "Open Workspace" option. Then open the
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\all\all.dsw workspace. 

      You should find windows project files listed as "all files, 
      big files etc." on the left.        

      3. (Optional) HDF5 C++, Fortran libraries and Intel compiler
    
      3.1 Skip this step if you do not want to build HDF5 C++ libraries
        
          Go to "Project" and select "dependencies";
          Select "all" in the "Select project to modify:" box,
          then enable the desired projects:
      
             dsets_cpp
             dsets_cppdll
             hdf5_cpp
             hdf5_cppdll
             testhdf5_cpp
             testhdf5_cppdll

      3.2 Skip this step if you do not want to build HDF5 Fortran
          libraries
        
          Go to "Project" and select "dependencies";
          Select "all" in the "Select project to modify:" box,
          then enable the desired projects:
              
             flush1_fortran
             flush1_fortrandll
             flush2_fortran
             flush2_fortrandll
             hdf5_f90cstub
             hdf5_f90cstubdll
             hdf5_fortran
             hdf5_fortrandll
             libtest_cstubdll
             libtest_fortran
             libtest_fortrandll
             testhdf5_fortran
             testhdf5_fortrandll

      3.3 Skip this step if you are not using Intel 7.x compilers
    
          a. Intel C Compiler
             Go to Tools-->Select Compiler
             Check Intel box and click OK button.
          
          b. Intel Fortran Compiler
             Go to Tools-->Select Compiler
             Check Intel box and click OK button.
             Go to Tools-->Customize-->Add-ins and Macro Files
             and check Intel Fortran Compiler Build Tool
           
          Note: Szip library is different when using Intel 7.x compiler.
                You should build Szip source codes with Intel
                compiler or download binaries for Intel compiler
                from ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/szip/bin/windows.
                The Szip library and header path should also be 
                set up accordingly (refer to precondition 6).
               
      4. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

         In "Project configurations", select the active configuration

            "all -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of
                    single-threaded static libraries, Debug 
                    multithreaded DLLs and tests. 
                
                    or

            "all -- Win32 Release" to build release versions of
                    single-threaded static libraries, 
                    multithreaded DLLs and tests.

        Then build project "all".
       
        Warning messages can be ignored.

    STEP 2: Testing HDF5 libraries and tools
    ========================================

      HDF5 libraries and tools should be tested to make sure that they
      were built correctly.

      We provide 2 options for users to test HDF5 libraries and tools.  

      <<---Option 1: Automatic testings--->>

      HDF5 comes with various test suites, all of which can be tested
      with hdf5check.bat batch file in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.

      To use automatic testing batch file, you must build both HDF5 
      release and debug libraries.

      hdf5check batch file can be run with one of the following four
      options:
   
      hdf5check                  test HDF5 C library and tools only
      
      hdf5check enablecpp        test HDF5 C/C++ libraries and tools
                                 To use this option, HDF5 C++ 
                                 libraries must have been built 
                                 in step I.
      
      hdf5check enablefortran    test HDF5 C/FORTRAN libraries and
                                 tools
                                 To use this option, HDF5 Fortran
                                 libraries must have been built 
                                 in step I.      
      
      hdf5check enableall        test HDF5 C/C++/FORTRAN libraries
                                 and tools
                                 To use this option, HDF5 C++ and 
                                 Fortran libraries must have been
                                 built in step I.      

      Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with appropriate
      option.

      Test results are saved in two files:

      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt   

      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt.

      In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If all the
      tests passed, then you do not have to check check_results.txt.  
      If some tests failed, check check_results.txt can help you
      figure out what was wrong.

      <<---Option 2: Step-by-step HDF5 libraries and tools testings--->>

      You can also test HDF5 libraries and tools one by one.  There are
      possibly four versions of HDF5 libraries and tools testings. 

      They are:

      release version
      release dll version
      debug version
      debug dll version

      We strongly suggest you to redirect your testing results into an
      output file so that you can easily check the testing results. You
      may use either Notepad or WordPad or whatever other windows word
      processor to check the results.  For the purpose of printing,  
      please choose font less than 14 for better alignment of the text.

      DLLs listed below should be placed into the Windows system
      directory.  A batch file named install_dll.bat is included in 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.  Run this batch file and the 
      following HDF5 DLLs will be copied to the system directory.

      hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\release\hdf5dll.dll
      hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\debug\hdf5ddll.dll
      hdf5\test\libtestD\release\libtestD.dll
      hdf5\test\libtestD\debug\libtestDd.dll

      1. HDF5 library testing 

      cd into the hdf5\test directory.

      Use Notepad or WordPad to check results. You should 
      not find any FAILED marks in your output files.

      2. HDF5 tools testing
 
      To test HDF5 tools, cd back into hdf5 directory and then cd into 
      tools directory(c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools).  The HDF5 tools testing
      results are saved into output files in tools directory by the
      testhdf5tools.bat as described below.

      Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

         a) release static version

         type:
            testhdf5tools debug dll
         output file: toolstest_debugdll.txt 
               
      Use Notepad or WordPad to check results. You should 
      not find any FAILED marks in your output files.
    
      3. HDF5 C++ library test
  
      Skip this step UNLESS you have built HDF5 C++ libraries
      and want to test them.
     
      DLLs listed below should be placed into to the Windows system
      directory.  A batch file named install_cppdll.bat is included in 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.  Run this batch file and the 
      following HDF5 C++ DLLs will be copied to the system directory.
       
         hdf5\proj\hdf5_cppdll\release\hdf5_cppdll.dll
         hdf5\proj\hdf5_cppdll\debug\hdf5_cppddll.dll

      Run hdf5cpptest.bat in the hdf5\c++\test directory at the 
      command prompt as below:
     
         hdf5cpptest release >"Your output filename"
         hdf5cpptest release dll >"Your output filename"
         hdf5cpptest debug >"Your output filename"
         hdf5cpptest debug dll >"Your output filename"

      Use Notepad or WordPad to check results. You should 
      not find any FAILED marks in your output files.
     
      4. HDF5 Fortran library test
  
      Skip this step UNLESS you have built HDF5 Fortran libraries     
      and want to test them.
     
      DLLs listed below should be placed into to the Windows system
      directory.  A batch file named install_f90dll.bat is included in 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.  Run this batch file and the 
      following HDF5 Fortran DLLs will be copied to the system
      directory.
       
      hdf5\proj\hdf5_f90cstubdll\release\hdf5_f90cstubdll.dll
      hdf5\proj\hdf5_f90cstubdll\debug\hdf5_f90cstubddll.dll
      hdf5\proj\hdf5_fortrandll\release\hdf5_fortrandll.dll
      hdf5\proj\hdf5_fortrandll\debug\hdf5_fortranddll.dll
      hdf5\fortran\test\libtest_cstubdll\release\libtest_cstubdll.dll

      Run testhdf5_fortran.bat at the command prompt as below:

         testhdf5_fortran release >"Your output filename"
         testhdf5_fortran release dll >"Your output filename"
         testhdf5_fortran debug >"Your output filename"
         testhdf5_fortran debug dll >"Your output filename"

      Use Notepad or WordPad to check results. You should 
      not find any FAILED marks in your output files.

     
    STEP 3: Installing HDF5 Libraries
    =================================

      We provide a batch file for users to relocate all HDF5 libraries
      in one folder (C++ and Fortran libraries will also be copied 
      into this folder if they have been built in step I).  The file 
      is called installhdf5lib.bat under c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory. 
      Run the batch file, you may see a folder called hdf5lib under 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5.  
    
      The <release> layout of <hdf5lib> should be:
    
      release\include   --  HDF5 header files
      release\bin       --  HDF5 static tool executables
      release\bindll    --  HDF5 DLL tool executables
      release\lib       --  HDF5 static libraries
      release\dll       --  HDF5 DLLs
       
      You may also find the similar layout for the <debug>.


    STEP 4: Building HDF5 C/C++/Fortran examples (Optional)
    =======================================================

      Simple examples have been provided for users to test HDF5
      C/C++/Fortran library and tools.

      Note: 
        1) To build HDF5 C++ examples, HDF5 C++ library must have been
        built in step I.

        2) To build HDF5 Fortran examples, HDF5 Fortran library must
        have been built in step I.

        3) To build HDF5 HL C examples, HDF5 HL library must have been
        built in step I.

        4) By default, the debug versions of HDF5 C/C++/Fortran examples
        are linked with the debug versions of HDF5 C/C++/Fortran
        libraries and DLLs.  The debug versions of HDF5 C/C++/Fortran
        examples will fail if they are linked with HDF5 binary
        distribution, which only includes the release versions of
        HDF5 C/C++/Fortran libraries and DLLs.


      <<---To build and test HDF5 C examples--->>

        1. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select
        the "Open Workspace" option. 
      
        Then open the workspace
        c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\allexamples\allexamples.dsw.

        2. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

        In "Project configurations", select the active configuration

        "allexamples -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of the
                        C examples.

        and
	
        "allexamples -- Win32 Release" to build release versions the 
                        C examples.

        When the debug build or release build is done, there should be the 
        following subdirectories in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\

          attributetest
          attributetestdll
          chunkread
          chunkreaddll
          compoundtest 
          compoundtestdll
          extendwritetest 
          extendwritetestdll
          grouptest 
          grouptestdll
          readtest 
          readtestdll
          selecttest 
          selecttestdll
          writetest 
          writetestdll

        3. Invoke a command prompt window and run the batch file 
        InstallExamples.bat which resides in the top level directory
        (c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5).  This file creates 4 new directories, 
        examplesREL, examplesRELDLL, examplesDBG, and examplesDBGDLL,
        in the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\examples directory and places all the
        executables in it.  Both the release and debug versions of the
        examples should be built before this step is done.

        4. We provide a batch file named testExamples.bat and an expected
        examples tests output file named testExamples_exp_output.txt
        in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\examples directory for you to test HDF5
        C examples. You need to run InstallExamples.bat before running 
        testExamples.bat. 
      
        testExamples.bat batch file has 4 options:

         testExamples release     -- for release version

         testExamples release dll -- for release DLL version

         testExamples debug       -- for debug version

         testExamples debug dll   -- for debug DLL version

        Invoke a command prompt window and run testExamples with
        appropriate options.  You should get "All HDF5 C examples tests
        passed." when the C examples are built successfully. Otherwise,
        the difference between the expected outputs and actual outputs
        will be given.

      <<---To build and test HDF5 C++ examples--->>

        1. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select
        the "Open Workspace" option. 

        Then open the workspace
        c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\c++\examples\allcppexamples\allcppexamples.dsw.

        2. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

        In "Project configurations", select the active configuration

        "allcppexamples -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of the
                           C++ examples.

        and
	
        "allcppexamples -- Win32 Release" to build release versions the 
                           C++ examples.

        When the debug build or release build is done, there should be  
        the following subdirectories in 
        c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\c++\examples\

          chunkstest
          chunkstestdll

          readdatatestdll 
          writedatatest 
          writedatatestdll 

        3. Invoke a command prompt window and run the batch file 
        InstallcppExamples.bat which resides in the top level directory
        (c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5).  This file creates 4 new directories, 
        cppexamplesREL, cppexamplesRELDLL, cppexamplesDBG,
        and cppexamplesDBGDLL, in the c:\MyHDFstuff\c++\examples
        directory and places all the executables in it.  Both the 
        release and debug versions of the examples should be built
        before this step is done.

        4. We provide a batch file named testcppExamples.bat in
        c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\c++\examples directory for you to test HDF5
        C++ examples. You should run InstallcppExamples.bat before
        running testcppExamples.bat.
      
        testcppExamples.bat batch file has 4 options:

         testcppExamples release     -- for release version

         testcppExamples release dll -- for release DLL version

         testcppExamples debug       -- for debug version 

         testcppExamples debug dll   -- for debug DLL version 

        Invoke a command prompt window and run testcppExamples with
        appropriate options.  You should get "All HDF5 C++ examples 
        tests passed." when the C++ examples are built successfully.  
        Otherwise, the difference between the expected outputs and 
        actual outputs will be given.

        <<---To build and test HDF5 Fortran example--->>

        1. Invoke Compaq visual Fortran or intel Fortran under Microsoft 
        Visual studio development environment, go to "File" and select
        the "Open Workspace" option.

        Then open the workspace
        c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\fortran\examples\allf90examples\allf90examples.dsw.

        2. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

        In "Project configurations", select the active configuration

        "allf90examples -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of the
                           Fortran examples.

        and
	
       "allf90examples -- Win32 Release" to build release versions the 
                          Fortran examples.

        When the debug build or release build is done, there should 
        be the following subdirectories in

        3. Invoke a command prompt window and run the batch file 
        Installf90Examples.bat which resides in the top level 
        directory (c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5).  This file creates 4 new 
        directories, f90examplesREL, f90examplesRELDLL, f90examplesDBG, 
        and f90examplesDBGDLL, in the c:\MyHDFstuff\fortran\examples 
        directory and places all the executables in it.  Both the 
        release and debug versions of the examples should be built 
        before this step is done.

        <<----To build and test HDF5 HL C examples--->>

        1. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select
        the "Open Workspace" option.

        One or more of the HL C examples Failed. 



Section III: Building an application using the HDF5 library or DLL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Waring: The instructions below will only describe how to build an
            application using the release version of the HDF5 library 
            or DLL. To use the debug version of the HDF5 library or 
            DLL, you need to substitute the release version of the 
            HDF5 library or DLL with the debug version.

    To use HDF5 static library
    ==========================

    To build an application that uses the HDF5 static library the
    following locations will need to be specified for locating header
    files and linking with the HDF static library, for example:

    c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\include
    c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\lib

    if you have installed HDF5 library in Section II, step 3.

    We assume that you will use Zlib and Szip compression with HDF5
    library.

    To specify these locations in the settings for your VC++ project,
    you may choose one of the following two methods.

    1) Method One

    Step 1: 
    To insert the path that specifies HDF5 and Zlib, Szip header files:

    1. Open your VC++ project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it
       is the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the "Settings" option.

    3. Choose the build configuration you would like to modify in the
       drop down menu labeled with "Settings For:"

    4. Choose the C/C++ tab

    5. Choose "Preprocessor" in the drop down menu labeled with
       "Category:"

    6. In a text-area labeled with "Additional include directories:",
       add HDF5, Zlib, and Szip header files directories.  For example:
       
          c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\include
          c:\zlib122\include
          c:\szip\include

       Then click OK.

    7. (optional) to use HDF5 Fortran static library, the location of 
       Fortran module files should be specified by following
       Project->Settings->Fortran->Preprocessor,
       and in a test-area labeled with "INCLUDE and USE Paths:", add
       HDF5 Fortran module files directories.  For example:

          c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\include

    Step 2: 
    To link the HDF5 library with your application:

    1. Open your VC++ project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it
       is the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the "Add to Project" option and
       then "Files" option.

    3. Change the "Files of type:" to "Library Files (.lib)"

    4. Navigate through the directories until you find the location of 
       the hdf5.lib. 

    5. Select hdf5.lib and click OK.

    6. repeat 1-5, to select zdll.lib and szlibdll.lib.

    7. (optional) repeat 1-5, to select hdf5_cpp.lib to link with HDF5
       C++ static library.

    8. (optional) repeat 1-5, to select hdf5_fortran.lib to link with
       HDF5 Fortran static library.

    2)  Method Two

    1. Go to Tools->Options->Directories,

    2. Insert the correct HDF5, Zlib, Szip paths for both headers
       (include) and libraries.  For example, 
       
          c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\include
          c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\lib
          c:\zlib122\include
          c:\zlib122\lib
          c:\szip\include
          c:\szip\dll

    3. Go to the Project menu and choose the "Settings" option.

    4. Find the "link" option and "Input" category, insert 
       "zdll.lib, szlibdll.lib, hdf5.lib".

    5. (Optional) repeat 3-4, to insert "hdf5_cpp.lib" if you want to 
       use HDF5 C++ static library.

    6. (Optional) repeat 3-4, to insert "hdf5_fortran.lib" if you want
       to use HDF5 Fortran static library.


    To use the DLL:

    1. Follow the steps for specifying the location of the header files
       as shown above.

    2. Follow the steps for linking the HDF5 library as shown above
       except now link the export library that is created with the DLL.
       The export library is called hdf5dll.lib for HDF5 C libray,
       hdf5_cppdll.lib for HDF5 C++ library, and hdf5_fortrandll.lib
       for HDF5 Fortran library.

    3. Place the DLL in a location that Windows will be able to 
       locate it. The searched path and order for DLL's is

       a) The directory where the executable module for the current
          process is located.
       b) The current directory. 
       c} The Windows system directory. The GetSystemDirectory 
          function retrieves the path of this directory. 
       d) The Windows directory. The GetWindowsDirectory function
          retrieves the path of this directory.
       e) The directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
 
    4. To modify your own application settings, please DO FOLLOW the 
       "DLL Hints" at section IV "HELPFUL POINTERS".


Section IV: HELPFUL POINTERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Here are some notes that may be of help if you are not familiar 
    with using the Visual C++ Development Environment.

    Project name and location issues: 
       
    If you must install all.dsw and all.dsp in another directory,
    relative to hdf5 directory, you will be asked to locate the 
    sub-project files, when you open the project all.dsw.

    If you want to rename all (the entire project), you will need to
    modify two files all.dsw and all.dsp as text (contrary to the
    explicit warnings in the files).

    You can also modify all.dsw and all.dsp as text, to allow these 2
    files to be installed in another directory.

  
    Settings... details:

    If you create your own project, the necessary settings can be read
    from the all.dsp file(as text), or from the Project Settings in the
    Developer Studio project settings dialog.

    Project
       Settings
          C/C++
             Category
                Code Generation
                   Use run-time Library
                      These are all set to use Single-Threaded

    DLL... hints:
  
    If you want to use DLL versions of HDF5 library in your application, 
    you should  
      1) put HDF5 DLL into windows system directory
      2) add HDF5 DLL export library into your project
      3) Follow "Settings... details" into the last line:
         change Single-Threaded into Multithreaded DLL or 
         Debug Multithreaded DLL
      4) Follow "Settings.. details" into PreProcessor:
         Project
            Settings
               C/C++
                  Category
                     PreProcessor

         Find PreProcessor definations and Add _HDF5USEDLL_ at the
         end of the PreProcessor definitions to use HDF5 C DLL.

      5) (optional) repeat 4), add HDF5CPP_USEDLL at the
         end of the PreProcessor definitions to use HDF5 C++ DLL.

      6) (optional) Follow Project->Settings->Fortran->Category->
         General->Predefined Preprocess or Symbols, and add 
         "HDF5F90_WINDOWS" to use HDF5 Fortran DLL.


Section V: How to disable Gzip(Zlib)/Szip compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


     Warning: When you modify the H5pubconf.h file as described below,
              DO NOT just change the values of these macros from 1 to 0.
              Please DO remove(or comment out) appropriate lines.
         
    1. Disable Gzip compression 

    If you would like to remove Gzip compression from the HDF5
    library, follow the steps below.

      1.1 Open the H5pubconf.h file from the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\src
          directory and remove(or comment out) the following two lines:

             #define H5_HAVE_ZLIB_H 1
             #define H5_HAVE_FILTER_DEFLATE 1

          then save the file.
	  
      1.2 Delete HDF5_EXT_ZLIB environment variable if you have
          set it in preconditions.
   
      1.3 Run-compile HDF5 library according to section II.

      When you disable Gzip, you may get the following message
      when building HDF5 libraries:

      The following environment variables were not found
      $(HDF5_EXT_ZLIB)

      This message can be ignored.

    2. Disable Szip compression (both encoder and decoder)

      If you would like to remove Szip compression from the HDF5
      library, follow the steps below.

      2.1 Open the H5pubconf.h file from the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\src
          directory and remove(or comment out) the following three
          lines: 

             #define H5_HAVE_SZLIB_H 1
             #define H5_HAVE_FILTER_SZIP 1
             #define H5_SZIP_CAN_ENCODE 1
		   
          then save the file.
	
      2.2 Delete HDF5_EXT_SZIP environment variable if you have
          set it in preconditions.

      2.3 Run-compile HDF5 library according to section II.

      When you disable Szip, you may get the following message 
      when building HDF5 libraries:

      The following environment variables were not found
      $(HDF5_EXT_SZIP)

      This message can be ignored.

    Note:   

    To disable Gzip and Szip at the same time, just follow 1.1~1.3
    and 2.1~2.4 and run-compile HDF5 library according to section II.

    3. Disable Szip encoder

      If you would like to just disable Szip encoder from the HDF5
      library while keeping Szip decoder enabled, follow the steps
      below.

      3.1 Download Szip library without encoder

          Szip library is different if you want to disable Szip 
          encoder. Download szip_noencoder binaries from
          ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/szip/bin/windows.
          The Szip library and header path should also be set up
          accordingly (refer to precondition 6).
   
      3.2 Open the H5pubconf.h file from the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\src
          directory and remove (or comment out) the following line: 

             #define H5_SZIP_CAN_ENCODE 1
		   
          then save the file.
	
      3.3 Run-compile HDF5 library according to section II.


Section VI: 
How to build HDF5 in VS 7.0(.NET) and intel 8.x with .NET environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    We just briefly introduce you how to build HDF5 in VS 7.0(.NET)
    and intel 8.x with .NET environment

    1. Build HDF5 in VS 7.x(.NET)

    1.1 You need to specify the zlib and szip include header files 
    and libraries under Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories 
    and choose Include libraries under the category of 
    "show directories for" to add the corresponding path if you want 
    to use compression feature inside HDF5.
    
    1.2 Open the old workspace file with the "Open solution" option,
    .NET will ask you whether you want to convert all VS 6.0 project 
    files to .NET corresponding project files, choose <CONVERT ALL>,
    .NET will automatically convert the data space file to solution 
    file.
    
    1.3 Then find  "Build" and go to "Configuration Manager"; choose
    "release" or "debug", if you don't want to build C++ or Fortran 
    libraries, you need to explicitly turn off project files in the 
    "Configuration Manager" and then choose "build all".
   
    1.4 If you want to change some project setting, select the project 
        and right click the button to choose Properties; find the 
        similar menu there as in 6.0.

    2. Build HDF5 in Intel 8.x with .NET environment

    2.1 Repeat 1.1 - 1.2 of this section. You may need to install 
        intel 8.x version of szip library.

    2.2 Right click Solution "all" in the "Solution Explorer" window, 
        choose "Convert to use Intel C++ Project System".

    2.3 Repeat 1.3 - 1.4 of this section. 

    NOTE: 
    Please read section V if you do not want to use compression
    feature inside HDF5.
 

Section VII: Building and testing HDF5 snapshot release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Note: 
    This section is only for users who would like to build and test 
    HDF5 snapshot release.

    If you want to test and build HDF5 snapshot release, you need 
    extra steps to automatically generate H5Tinit.c before going to 
    section II step 1(2).

    Previous step: section II, step 1(1).
    
    Extra steps:
    1) After extracting all.zip to the correct path, open the 
    c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\misc\typegen\typegen.dsw.
    
    2) Build the project file.

    3) Invoke command prompt and go to c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\src.

    4) type H5Tinit.exe >H5Tinit.c

    5) Go back to section II, continue with step 1(2).


Section VIII: Misc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1) drivers we support

    The default driver on windows we support is sec2 driver. However, 
    stdio driver is also supported. If you want to use stdio driver 
    in your application, you may set environment variable HDF5_DRIVER 
    to "stdio".

    On windows 2000/XP, the following steps should be followed to set
    the environment variable,

      a) Go to Control panel and find "system",
      b) Click "system" and choose "advanced",
      c) Choose Environment Variables
      d) Add new variable "HDF5_DRIVER"
      e) set the "HDF5_DRIVER" to "stdio"

    Reminder: 
    If you don't want to use stdio driver, please remember to 
    delete the environment variable "HDF5_DRIVER" or change the 
    variable value to "sec2".

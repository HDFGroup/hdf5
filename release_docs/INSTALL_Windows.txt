HDF5 Build and Install Instructions for Windows 2000/NT/98.
----------------------------------------------------------

The instructions which follow assume that you will be using the 
source code release 'zip' file (hdf5-1_4_2.zip).

***************************WARNINGS****************************
Please read CAREFULLY about Preconditions before you go to the 
following sections

Preconditions 

   1. Installed MicroSoft Developer Studio,Visual C++ 6.0 and 
      WinZip.

   2. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library. 
      For example:

	    c:\					(any drive)
	   MyHDFstuff\				(any folder name)

   3. Run WinZip on hdf5-1_4_2.zip (the entire source tree) and
      extract hdf5 package into c:\MyHDFstuff(or whatever drive 
      and folder name you would like to choose). This creates a 
      directory called 'hdf5'under MyHDFstuff which contains 
      several files and directories.

   4. HDF5 uses zlib for compression and zlib is distributed 
      with hdf5 lib. If you have your own version read section 
      VI about the zlib library.

   5. You do need hdf4 (hdf and mfhdf) static and dll libraries 
      to generate hdf4-related tools.

   6. Currently you can build and test either hdf5 libraries  
      and non-hdf4 related tools or hdf5 libraries and hdf4  
      related tools;but not BOTH.In other words,you may either 
      follow Section II or Section III but NOT both Sections to 
      build HDF5 libraries and related tools.

Section II: 

  Building and testing hdf5 libraries and non-hdf4 related tools 

      ==================================================

STEP 1: Building hdf5 libraries and non-hdf4 related tools


    1. Unpack all.zip in 'hdf5' and move the zlib.dll from
       c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\src\zlib\dll to the Windows system 
       directory.

	 The system directory can usually be found under the path 
		C:\WINNT\system or C:\WINDOWS\system
      
    2. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select 
       the "Open Workspace" option. 

       Then open the c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\all\all.dsw 
       workspace. 

    3. If you don't want to build and test backward 
       compatibility with hdf5 1.2, you may skip this part and
       go to part 4.

       To build and test backward compatibility with hdf5 1.2, 
           a) go to "Project" and select "Settings"
           b) A window called "Project Settings" should be 
              popped up,on the upper-left corner is a small box 
              "Settings For". Set the option to 
              "Win32 Release".
           c) Go to the the right side of "Project Settings" 
              window,choose C/C++ on the menu.
           d) Go to the "Category" box below menu bar, choose 
              Preprocessor.
           e) Go to "Preprocessor definitions" box below   
              "Category". Inside the box, type 
              "WANT_H5_V1_2_COMPAT". Note: don't type double 
              quote for "WANT_H5_V1_2_COMPAT" and add a comma
              between "WANT_H5_V1_2_COMPAT" and the last 
              preprocessor definations(WIN32).
           f) click OK at the bottom of "Project Settings" 
              window.
           g) repeat a)-f) and choose the option as 
              "win32 Debug" on step b).
             
    4. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

       On Windows platform select as the active configuration

	   "all -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of
	    single-threaded static libraries, Debug multithreaded
          DLLs and tests. 
                or

	   "all -- Win32 Release" to build release versions of
          single-threaded static libraries, multithreaded DLLs
          and tests.

      
       NOTE : "all" is a dummy target. You will get a link  
              error when "all.exe." is built:

             LINK: error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
			_mainCRTStartup.....
             all.exe - 2 error(s), ....

       Warning messages can be ignored. The "all.exe" is never 
       created, so it is OK.

       When the debug or release build is done the directories 
       listed below will contain the following files:

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5\debug - 
            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5\release - 

                  hdf5.lib- the hdf5 library

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\debug - 

                  hdf5ddll.dll- the hdf5 library
                  hdf5ddll.lib- the dll export library                  

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\release - 

                  hdf5dll.dll- the hdf5 library
                  hdf5dll.lib- the dll export library

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\test\"test directory"-

            where test directory is one of the following:

			big(dll)

			bittests(dll)

			chunk(dll)

			cmpd_dset(dll)

			dsets(dll)

			dtypes(dll)
			
			enum(dll)

			extend(dll)

			external(dll)

			fillval(dll)

			flush1(dll)

			flush2(dll)

			gheap(dll)

			hyperslab(dll)

			iopipe(dll)

			istore(dll)

			links(dll)

			mount(dll) 

			mtime(dll)

			ohdr(dll)

			overhead(dll)

			stab(dll)

			testhdf5(dll) 

			unlink(dll)

            
		c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslib\debug
	      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslib\release

                  toolslib.lib- the tools library

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslibD\debug
	      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\toolslibD\release

                  toolslibD.lib- the dll export library 

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\"tools directory"-
            where non-hdf4 related tools directory is one of the 
            following:
 
	            h5dump(dll)

                  h5ls(dll)

                  h5debug(dll)

                  h5import(dll)
                    
                  h5repart(dll)	            
		

           Test and tool directory contains debug and release 
           subdirectories with the corresponding tests and tools.


STEP 2:   testing hdf5 libraries and non-hdf4 related tools 

In a command prompt window run the test batch file which resides in 
the hdf5\test directory(for example: C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\test)to make 
sure that the library was built correctly.

You can possibily test four versions of hdf5 library and tools. They are:

	release version
	release dll version
	debug version
	debug dll version

NOTE: The hdf5ddll.dll and hdf5dll.dll should be placed into
the C:\WINNT\system or C:\WINDOWS\system directory before using the dlls.

We strongly suggest you to redirect your testing results into
an output file and you can easily check the testing results. 
You may use either NotePad or NoteTab Light or whatever other
windows tools to check the results. For the purpose of printing, 
please choose font less than 14 for better alignment of the text.

  1. hdf5 library testing 

     cd into the hdf5\test directory. 

        (1) basic tests
            
            Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

            a) release static version
            type:             
               hdf5test release >"Your output filename" 

	      b) release dll version
            type:
               hdf5test release dll > "Your output filename"
				
            c) debug static version
            type: 
               hdf5test debug >"Your output filename"

            d) debug dll version
            type:
               hdf5test debug dll >"Your output filename"
            
        (2) timing tests

            Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

            a) release static version
            type:             
               hdf5timingtest release >"Your output filename" 

	      b) release dll version
            type:
             hdf5timingtest release dll >"Your output filename"
				
            c) debug static version
            type: 
               hdf5timingtest debug >"Your output filename"

            d) debug dll version
            type:
               hdf5timingtest debug dll >"Your output filename"


     Use notepad or notetab light to check results. You should 
not find any FAILED marks in your output files.

  Note: big test is currently not working for windows, we are 
still investigating this.
 
 2. hdf5 tools testing
 
    Currently we are only supporting h5dump test. We are 
investigating h5ls test now. 
    
    1) h5dump test

    cd back into hdf5 directory and then cd into tools
directory(...\hdf5\tools)

    Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

        a) release static version
        type:             
           dumptest release >"Your output filename" 

	  b) release dll version
        type:
           dumptest release dll > "Your output filename"
				
        c) debug static version
        type: 
           dumptest debug >"Your output filename"

        d) debug dll version
        type:
           dumptest debug dll >"Your output filename"
   

    We are using "fc" command to compare whether dumper 
generates correct results. Supposedly you should find 
"FC: no differences encountered" in your output file. 
However, since we are comparing the actual dumper output
with the expected dumper output under different directory, 
you may see something like:

"
***** ..\TESTFILES\tall-1.ddl
#############################
Expected output for 'h5dump tall.h5'
#############################
HDF5 "tall.h5" {
GROUP "/" {
***** TALL-1.RESULTS
HDF5 "..\..\testfiles\tall.h5" {
GROUP "/" {
*****
"

   The actual dumper output is correct. The difference showing 
here is the different representations of filename of the same 
file.

STEP 3: BUILDING THE EXAMPLES

    1. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select
       the "Open Workspace" option. 
       Then open the workspace
       c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\allexamples\allexamples.dsw.

    2. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

       On Windows platform select as the active configuration

	   "allexamples -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions 
          of the examples.

                or
	
	   "allexamples -- Win32 Release" to build release 
          versions the examples.

          When the debug build or release build is done 
          there should be the following subdirectories in 
          C:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\

			attributetest
 
			chunkread

			compoundtest 

			extendwritetest 

			grouptest 

			readtest 

			selecttest 

			writetest 



    3. Run the batch file "InstallExamples.bat" which 
       resides in the top level directory(C:\MyHDFSTUFF\hdf5).
       This file creates 2 new directories,examplesREL and 
       examplesDBG,in the examples directory and places
       all the executables in it. Both the release and debug
       versions of the examples should be built before this 
       step is done. The examples should be tested in these 2 
       new directories due to some dependencies between the 
       examples. Especially writetest.exe and extendwritetest.exe 
       should be executed before chunkread.exe and readtest.exe 
       due to dependencies among these files.

Section III: BUILDING AND TESTING HDF5 LIBRARIES AND ALL HDF5 TOOLS

------------------WARNINGS---------------------------------

1. This section is specifically for building HDF5 tools that needs to call HDF4 library. 

Currently we are supporting two hdf4-relatedtools: H4toh5 converter 
and H5toh4 converter. If you are not using these tools, please go 
back to Section II for building and installing information. 

2. This section builds and tests all versions of hdf5 libraries, 
testing programs and tools covered in section II. 
Additionally, it also builds and tests hdf4-related tools. We may refer some duplicated parts of this section to section II. 

3. In case 
     a) you don't install hdf libraries and related tools in
        your machine, 
     b) or if the top directory of your hdf4 libraries and 
        tools are not under C:\hdf41r4 and you are not familar
        on how to change settings of VC++ projects.

   you may get binary distribution from 
ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF/HDF4.1r4/windows_precompiled_code/HDF41r4.zip 
and use Winzip to unpack HDF41r4.zip into C:\hdf41r4.

4. We assume that you've installed hdf4(mfhdf and hdf) 
libraries into drive C. The top level path should be 
C:\HDF41r4. Under C:\HDF41r4 it should at least 
include the following six directories: 

C:\HDF41r4\bin where hdf4 utilities are stored

C:\HDF41r4\dlllib where release dll versions of hdf and mfhdf 
libraries and export libraries of dlls are stored

C:\HDF41r4\dlllibdbg where debug dll versions of hdf and mfhdf 
libraries and export libraries of dlls are stored

C:\HDF41r4\lib where release versions of hdf and mfhdf 
libraries are stored

C:\HDF41r4\libdbg where debug versions of hdf and mfhdf 
libraries are stored

C:\HDF41r4\include where header files are included 

Make sure that you copy all *.dll files under C:\HDF41r4 into Windows
system directory before the next step.

If your path of hdf libraries and mfhdf libraries is different 
from the default assumption, please DO follow No.4 of Step 1 on 
the following:


Step 1. 
  
    1. Unpack all_withhdf4.zip in 'hdf5' and move the zlib.dll 
       from c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\src\zlib\dll to the Windows     
       system directory.

	 The system directory can usually be found under the path 
		C:\WINNT\system or C:\WIN98\system
      
    2. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select the 
       "Open Workspace" option. 

       Then open the c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\all\all.dsw 
       workspace. 
    
    3. If you don't want to build and test backward 
       compatibility with hdf5 1.2, you may skip this part and 
       go to part 4.

       To build and test backward compatibility with hdf5 1.2, 
           a) go to "Project" and select "Settings"
           b) A window called "Project Settings" should be 
              popped up,on the upper-left corner is a small box 
              "Settings For" Choose the option to
              "Win32 Release".
           c) Go to the the right side of "Project Settings" 
              window, choose C/C++ on the menu.
           d) Go to the "Category" box below menu bar, choose 
              Preprocessor.
           e) Go to "Preprocessor definitions" box below 
              "Category". Inside the box, type 
              "WANT_H5_V1_2_COMPAT". Note: don't type
              double quote for "WANT_H5_V1_2_COMPAT" and add a 
              comma between "WANT_H5_V1_2_COMPAT" and the last               
              preprocessor defination(WIN32).
           f) click OK at the bottom of "Project Settings" 
              window.
           g) repeat a)-f) and set the option to "win32 Debug" 
              on step b).

    4. This part is for users who are familar with handling 
       settings of VC++ project and store their hdf4 libraries 
       not under C:\hdf41r4. Other users can skip this part. 
        
       4.1 Change the path where hdf4 library header files are 
       located

       a) On the View menu, click Workspace, you may see a 
          pop-up window with names of projects in all.dsw. 
       b) click FileView on the bottom of this window if you 
          are not seeing "all files big files ......."
       c) You need to modify settings of four projects: h4toh5, 
          h4toh5dll,h5toh4 and h5toh4dll.
          You also need to modify both debug and release 
          versions.
 
          You may do as follows: 
          c1)Right click the selected project and then click 
             "Settings"
          c2)A dialog box called "Project Settings" will be 
             poped up
          c3)On the upper-left part of the "Project Settings" 
             box, you may find a small window "Settings for".
             Make sure inside this "Settings for" box is either 
             "Win32 Debug" or "Win32 Release". Change contents
             into "Win32 Debug" or "Win32 Release" otherwise.
             Remember the version(Win32 Release or Debug) you
             chose.
          c4)On the upper-right menu of the "Project Settings" 
             window, find C/C++  and click it.
          c5)Just below the upper-right menu, find a small 
             window called category, make sure that 
             "Preprocessor" appear in this window.
          c6)In the middle of "Project Settings" windows, you 
             may find a box called 
             "Additional include directories:" . You may notice
             "C:\hdf41r4\include" inside this box. This is the 
             path where the default hdf4 header files is 
             included. Replace only this path
             (C:\hdf41r4\include) with your own path that
             includes your hdf4 header files. Don't touch any 
             other paths.
          c7)After you've done this, click OK at the bottom of 
             "Project Settings" window. 
          c8)Repeat c1)-c7)but change contents of "settings 
             for" in c3) from "Win32 Release" to "Win32 Debug" 
             or vice versa.
       d) repeat step c) for the other three projects.
       
	 4.2 Replace the user's hdf and mfhdf libraries, export 
           libraries of hdf and mfhdf DLLs

	 You also need to modify four projects: h4toh5,   
       h4toh5dll, h5toh4 and h5toh4dll:
       a) select project h4toh5 following instruction 4.1 a) 
          and b). 
       b) click h4toh5, you may find four libraries: 
          hm414d.lib,hd414d.lib and hm414.lib,hd414.lib 
          attached under the project h4toh5. hm414d.lib and 
          hd414d.lib are debug versions of mfhdf and hdf 
          libraries. hm414.lib and hd414.lib are release 
          versions of mfhdf and hdf libraries.
       c) select these four libraries; go back to Edit menu and 
          choose "delete" option to delete template of these 
          libraries. 
       d) select project h4toh5 and right click the mouse, find 
          "Add Files to Projects", follow the instructions on 
          the pop-up box, to insert your own hm414d.lib, 
          hd414d.lib,hm414.lib and hd414.lib. You must know 
          their paths at first.
       e) select project h4toh5dll following instruction 4.1 a) 
          and b).
       f) click h4toh5dll, you may also find four libraries: 
          hd414m.lib,hd414md.lib and hm414m.lib,hd414m.lib 
          attached under the project h4toh5dll. These libraries 
          are debug and release versions of Export libraries of 
          mfhdf and hdf DLLs. 
       g) select these four libraries; go back to Edit menu and 
          choose "delete" option to delete template of these 
          libraries. 
       h) select project h4toh5dll and right click the mouse, 
          find "Add Files to Projects", follow the instructions 
          on the pop-up box, to insert your own hd414m.lib, 
          hd414md.lib,hm414m.lib and hd414m.lib. You must know 
          their paths at first.
	 i) repeat a)-h) for h5toh4 and h5toh4dll.

    5. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

       On Windows platform select as the active configuration

	   "all -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions 
                              single-threaded static libraries, 
                              and tests. 
                or

	   "all -- Win32 Release" to build release versions of
                                   single-threaded static 
                                   libraries, and tests.

      
       NOTE : "all" is a dummy target. You will get a link 
              error when "all.exe." is built:

             LINK: error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
			_mainCRTStartup.....
             all.exe - 2 error(s), ....

       Warning messages can be ignored. The "all.exe" is never 
       created, so it is OK.

       You should see hdf5 libraries, tests and tools under   
       section II Step 1. 
       In addtion, under  c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools\       

       You may also find:
         h4toh5
         h5toh4 
         h4toh5dll
         h5toh4dll
       for both the debug and release versions.

STEP 2:   testing hdf5 libraries and all hdf5 tools 

     1. hdf5 library testing 
       Follow all instructions of the same part in Section II 
       STEP 2
    
     2. non-hdf4 related tools testing
       Follow all instructions of the same part in Section II 
       STEP 2

     3. hdf4-related tools testing

       1) h4toh5 converter tool testing
          
           First cd into hdf5\tools

           Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

           a) release static version
           type:             
            h4toh5testrun release >"Your output filename" 

 	     b) release dll version
           type:
            h4toh5testrun release dll > "Your output filename"
 				
           c) debug static version
           type: 
            h4toh5testrun debug >"Your output filename"

           d) debug dll version
           type:
            h4toh5testrun debug dll >"Your output filename"

        We are using "fc" command to compare whether h4toh5 
        converter converts the hdf4 file into the correct hdf5 
        file.In your output files, Please only pay attention to 
        those lines which start with
        "FC:",you should find "FC: no differences encountered"  
        for all tested hdf4 files in your output.
                       
        2) h5toh4 converter tool testing                
                                                             
        To test the h5toh4 utility, you need to have hdf4  
        dumper utility "hdp" in your system.

        Note: Currently h5toh4 release dll doesn't work
        for all test cases possibly due to windows dealing
        with "free memory" conventions for dll versions.      

       1) If your hdp utility is located at C:\hdf41r4\bin,
          you may skip this part. Otherwise, copy your hdp.exe
          file into the directory where your hdf5 tools are 
          located. For example, if your hdf5 tools directory is
          C:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\tools; please copy hdp.exe into
          this directory.
       
       2) cd into \...\hdf5\tools. 
          Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

           a) release static version
           type:             
            h5toh4testrun release >"Your output filename" 

 	     b) release dll version
           type:
            h5toh4testrun release dll > "Your output filename"
 				
           c) debug static version
           type: 
            h5toh4testrun debug >"Your output filename"

           d) debug dll version
           type:
            h5toh4testrun debug dll >"Your output filename"

        We are using "fc" command to compare whether h5toh4
        converter converts the hdf5 file into the correct hdf4 
        file.In your output files, Please only pay attention to 
        those lines which start with
        "FC:",you should find "FC: no differences encountered"  
        for all tested hdf4 files in your output.
        Warnings appear on the prompt when testing h5toh4 converter
        can be ignored. 
                
				
STEP 3: BUILDING THE EXAMPLES

      Follow all instructions of SECTION II STEP 3.

Section IV:  
BUILDING AN APPLICATION USING THE HDF5 LIBRARY OR DLL- SOME HELPFUL 
POINTERS
====================================================================

If you are building an application that uses the HDF5 library the
following locations will need to be specified for locating header files
and linking in the HDF libraries:

            <top-level HDF5 directory>\src

where <top-level HDF5 directory> may be 

            C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\

To specify this location in the settings for your VC++ project:

    1. Open your VC project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it is
       the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the 'Settings' option.

    3. Chose the build configuration you would like to modify in the
       drop down menu labeled with 'Settings For:'

    4. Chose the C/C++ tab

    5. At the bottom of the window, there should be a text-area labeled
       with 'Project Options:'. In this text-area, scroll until you
       reach the end and type /I "<top-level HDF5 directory>\src" and
       then click OK.

To link the HDF5 library with your application:

    1. Open your VC project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it is
       the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the 'Add to Project' option and
       then 'Files' option.

    3. Change the 'Files of type:' to 'Library Files (.lib)'

    4. Navigate through the directories until you find the location of 
       the hdf5.lib. 

    5. Select hdf5.lib and click OK.


To use the DLL:

    1. Follow the steps for specifing the location of the header files
       as shown above.

    2. Follow the steps for linking the HDF5 library as shown above
       except now link the export library that is created with the DLL.
       The export library is called hdf5dll.lib or hdf5ddll.lib for
       debug version.

    3. Place the DLL in a location that Windows will be able to locate 
       it. The search path and order for DLL's is

       a) The directory where the executable module for the current
          process is located.
       b) The current directory. 
       c} The Windows system directory. The GetSystemDirectory function 
          retrieves the path of this directory. 
       d) The Windows directory. The GetWindowsDirectory function
          retrieves the path of this directory.
       e) The directories listed in the PATH environment variable. 


Section V:
MORE HELPFUL POINTERS
=====================


Here are some notes that may be of help if you are not familiar with
using the Visual C++ Development Environment.

Project name and location issues: 
       
    The files in all.zip must end up in the hdf5\ directory installed by
    hdf5-1_4_2.zip

    If you must install all.dsw and all.dsp in another directory,
    relative to hdf5\ , you will be asked to locate the sub-project
    files, when you open the project all.dsw.

    If you want to rename all (the entire project), you will need to
    modify two files all.dsw and all.dsp as text (contrary to the
    explicit warnings in the files).

    You can also modify all.dsw and all.dsp as text, to allow these 2
    files to be installed in another directory.

  
Settings... details:

    If you create your own project, the necessary settings can be read
    from the all.dsp file(as text), or from the Project Settings in the
    Developer Studio project settings dialog.

    Project
	  Settings
	      C/C++
		  Category
		     PreProcessor
			 Code Generation
			    Use run-time Library
				   These are all set to use 
                                      Single-Threaded

DLL... hints:
  
   If you want to use DLL versions of hdf5 library in your application, 
   you should  
      1) put hdf5 DLL into windows system directory
      2) add hdf5 DLL export library into your project
      3) Follow "Settings... details" into the last line:
         change Single-Threaded into Multithreaded DLL or 
         Debug Multithreaded DLL
      4) Follow "Settings.. details" into PreProcessor:
         Project
	       Settings
	           C/C++
		       Category
		          PreProcessor

         Find PreProcessor definations and Add _HDF5USEDLL_ at the
         end of the PreProcessor definations
         



Section VI:
ZLIB LIBRARY- REMOVING OR CHANGING THE PATH
============================================

If you would like to remove the zlib library from the hdf5 library or 
use your own version of the zlib library then follow the steps below.

Removing the zlib library completely:

    Open the all.dsw workspace file in Microsoft Visual C++. Go to the
    hdf5 project. Select the zlib.lib file from this project and
    delete(press the 'delete' key) it. Next open the H5config.h and
    H5pubconf.h files from the src directory and remove the following
    two lines:

		#define HAVE_LIBZ 1
		#define HAVE_COMPRESS2

    then save the file.
	
    Next go to the hdf5dll project. Remove the zlib.lib from this 
    project too. Open the project settings for the hdf5dll project. 
    Go to the C/C++ settings tab and under the preprocessor definitions 
    remove the ZLIB_DLL in both the debug and the release settings. 
    Recompile the all project and then save the workspace.


Replacing the zlib library:

    Open the all.dsw workspace and go to the hdf5 project. Delete the
    zlib.lib file from the file listing. Then select the hdf5 project
    and richt click to get a menu. Pick the "add files to project..."
    option and find the version of the zlib that you would like to use.
    Then click OK in the file chooser dialog. Repeat the steps for the
    hdf5dll project. You may also want to replace the zlib.h and zconf.h
    files which are in the src directory with your own versions of these
    files. Then recompile the all project.

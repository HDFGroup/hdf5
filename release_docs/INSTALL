*****************************************************************************

1. Obtaining HDF5
        The latest supported public releases of HDF5 are available on
        https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5.

2. Third-party Software Requirements
2.1. Zlib
        The HDF5 library includes a predefined compression filter that
        uses the "deflate" method for chunked datasets. If zlib-1.1.2 or
        later is found, HDF5 will use it.  Otherwise, HDF5's predefined
        compression method will degenerate to a no-op; the compression
        filter will succeed but the data will not be compressed.

2.2. Szip (optional)
        The HDF5 library includes a predefined compression filter that
        uses the extended-Rice lossless compression algorithm for chunked
        datasets.

        Building instructions are available with the Szip source code.

        The HDF Group does not distribute separate Szip precompiled libraries,
        but the HDF5 pre-built binaries provided on The HDF Group download page
        include the Szip library with the encoder enabled. These can be found
        here:

           https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/

        Please notice that if HDF5 configure cannot find a valid Szip library,
        configure will not fail; in this case, the compression filter will
        not be available to the applications.

        To check if Szip compression was successfully configured in,
        check the "I/O filters (external):" line in the configure output,
        summary section, printed to the standard output.

2.3. MPI and MPI-IO
        The parallel version of the library is built upon the foundation
        provided by MPI and MPI-IO. If these libraries are not available
        when HDF5 is configured, only a serial version of HDF5 can be built.

3. HDF5 Source Code and Precompiled Binaries
        The HDF Group provides source code and pre-compiled binaries from the
        HDF5 github releases page:

        https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/releases

4. Build and Install HDF5 on Unix and Mac OSX Platforms with autotools
        see the release_docs/INSTALL_Autotools.txt file.

5. Build and Install HDF5 Libraries and tools with CMake
        see the release_docs/INSTALL_CMake.txt file.

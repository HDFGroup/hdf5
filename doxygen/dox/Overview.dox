This is the documentation set for HDF5. You can
<a href="hdf5-doc.tgz">download</a> it as a tgz archive for offline reading.

This is the documention set for HDF5 in terms of specifications and software
developed and maintained by <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/">The HDF
Group</a>. It is impractical to document the entire HDF5 ecosystem in one place,
and you should also consult the documentation sets of the many outstanding
community projects.

For a first contact with HDF5, the best place is to have a look at the \link
GettingStarted getting started \endlink page that shows you how to write and
compile your first program with HDF5.

The \b main \b documentation is organized by documentation flavor. Most
technical documentation consists to varying degrees of information related to
<em>tasks</em>, <em>concepts</em>, or <em>reference</em> material. As its title
suggests, the \link RM Reference Manual \endlink is 100% reference material,
while the \link Cookbook \endlink is focused on tasks. The different guide-type
documents cover a mix of tasks, concepts, and reference, to help a certain
<em>audience</em> succeed.

Finally, do not miss the search engine (top right-hand corner)! If you are
looking for a specific function, it'll take you there directly. If unsure, it'll
give you an idea of what's on offer and a few promising leads.

\par ToDo List
     There is plenty of <a href="./todo.html">unfinished business</a>.

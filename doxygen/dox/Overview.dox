This is the documentation set for HDF5.
It includes specifications and documentation
of software and tools developed and maintained by
<a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/">The HDF Group</a>. It is impractical to document
the entire HDF5 ecosystem in one place, and you should also consult the documentation
sets of the many outstanding community projects.

For a first contact with HDF5, the best place is to have a look at the \link
GettingStarted getting started \endlink page that shows you how to write and
compile your first program with HDF5.

The \b main \b documentation is organized by documentation flavor. Most
technical documentation consists to varying degrees of information related to
<em>tasks</em>, <em>concepts</em>, or <em>reference</em> material. As its title
suggests, the \link RM Reference Manual \endlink is 100% reference material,
while the \link Cookbook \endlink is focused on tasks. The different guide-type
documents cover a mix of tasks, concepts, and reference, to help a specific
<em>audience</em> succeed.

\subsection CB_UserBlock Creating an HDF5 File User Block

\par Problem
You would like to include certain ancillary, non-HDF5 content in an
HDF5 file such that it can be accessed without the HDF5 library

\par Solution
Use a file creation property list in which the user block size is set via
H5Pset_userblock(). In the example below, we create an 8 MiB user block.
\snippet Files.c user_block

\par Discussion
The user block begins at offset 0 and must be at least 512 bytes and a power
of 2. The HDF5 library ignores any content between the beginning of the
file and the end of the user block.\n
You can add or strip a user block to/from an existing HDF5 file with the
\Code{h5jam}/\Code{h5unjam} tool, respectively.
\warning
If you try to embed content into the user block for use by other applications,
pay close attention to how they handle space beyond the last used byte in the
user block or the user block in general. In the worst case, applications might
try to truncate the rest of the file and destroy the HDF5 portion of the file.

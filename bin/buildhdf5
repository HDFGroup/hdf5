cat <<EOF
Buildhdf5 builds the HDF5 library by running configure, make and make check.
It skips the configure part if one has been done already.  In effect, one
can continue from a previous build.

Command Syntax
==============
buildhdf5 [-config] [-gass] [-srcdir dir] config-arguments ...
   -config:	run configure only. [default to do build too]
   -gass:	configure for the GASS driver
   -help:	show this help page
   -n:   	no execution, just show commands
   -srcdir:	use dir as the source directory
             	   [Note: this is different from --srcdir
             	    which will be passed to configure]
   all other arguments are passed to configure


Configure in place or by srcdir
===============================
By default, the command looks for the configure command in
'.' and then '../hdf5'.  When it finds it, it uses it to do
the configure part.  In effect, if ./configure is found, it
does the build in place.  If it finds ../hdf5/configure, it
does the --srcdir (that is separated source) build.  Therefore,
if you have the following structure setup, you can run multiple
hosts building simultantously using a common source code.
     hdf5_1.4/hdf5        # holds the source
	  .../arabica     # for SunOS 2.7
	  .../arabicapp   # for SunOS 2.7 parallel
	  .../burrwhite   # for Linux 2.4

# Initialize file format:
# Each line is a keyword for action and the rest are values.
# Keywords:
# '#'           Comments
# skip          Files to be skipped
# prune         Directories to be skipped.  Notice this prunes all directories
#               with the same name.  E.g.,
#               "prune test" skips test, fortran/test, c++/test, ...
#		(See -name option in the find command.)
# prunepath     Directory or file to be skipped.  Notice this is different from
#               prunes since it matches the exact pathname. E.g.,
#               "prunepath ./tools/testfiles" skips the directory/file matching
#		exactly that path but NOT tools/h5dump/testfiles nor
#               tools/h5dump/testfiles.

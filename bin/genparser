# This script runs flex/lex and bison/yacc to generate parser code for
# the high-level library. It used to be a part of autogen.sh, but many
# people encountered problems with installing flex and bison on their
# system and the parser code rarely changes, so those parts of the
# script were moved to their own file.
#
# NOTE CAREFULLY!
#
# There is NO dependency in either the autotools or CMake to regenerate
# the parser code. If you modify H5LT analyze.l or H5LTparse.y, you
# will need to run this scrpit manually on a system with a suitable
# lexer and parser generator.
#
# IMPORTANT OS X NOTE
#
# If you are using OS X, you will probably not have flex or bison
# installed. In addtion, even if you do have bison installed, the bison
# version you have installed may also have a bug that makes it unable to
# process our input files.
#
# The easiest way to fix this is to install everything via Homebrew:
#
#   http://brew.sh/
#
# After you install the base packages, install flex/bison.
#
#   brew install flex
#   brew install bison
#
# END IMPORTANT OS X NOTE
#
# If you want to use a particular version of flex or bison, the paths
# to each tool can be overridden using the following environment
# variables:
#
#   HDF5_FLEX
#   HDF5_BISON
#
# This script takes two potential options:
#
# -p
#
# When this is selected, the flex/bison versions are set to the paths
# and versions used by The HDF Group to produce the released versions
# of the library.
#
# NOTE: This is probably temporary. Once we update our dev machines
# to have recent versions of the autotools this option will probably
# be removed.
#
# -v
#
# This emits some extra information, mainly tool versions.

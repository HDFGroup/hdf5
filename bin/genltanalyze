# fix H5LTparse.c to declare H5LTyyparse return type as an hid_t
# instead of int.  Currently the generated function H5LTyyparse is
# generated with a return value of type int, which is a mapping to the
# flex yyparse function.  The return value in the HL library should be
# an hid_t. 
# I propose to not use flex to generate this function, but for now I am 
# adding a perl command to find and replace this function declaration in
# H5LTparse.c.

# Scripts in `bin` and their purpose

Programs run via `autogen.sh` (or the equivalent in CMake) are indicated.

|Program|Purpose|
|-------|-------|
|`buildhdf5`|Convenience script to build HDF5 using the Autotools|
|`checkapi`|Checks if public API calls are used in internal functions|
|`chkcopyright`|Checks if files have appropriate copyright statements|
|`cmakehdf5`|Convenience script to build HDF5 using CMake|
|`debug-ohdr`|Examines debug output from `H5O_open/close` to look for open objects|
|`format_source`|Runs `clang-format` over the source files, applying our rules|
|`genparser`|Creates the flex/bison-based parser files in the high-level library|
|`h5cc.in`|Input file from which h5cc is created|
|`h5redeploy.in`|Input file from which h5redeploy is created|
|`h5vers`|Updates the library version number|
|`make_err`|Generates the H5E header files (called in `autogen.sh`)|
|`make_vers`|Generates H5version.h (called in `autogen.sh`)|
|`make_overflow`|Generates H5overflow.h (called in `autogen.sh`)|
|`output_filter`|Used in the tools test code to strip extraneous output before we diff files|
|`restore.sh`|Removes files generated by `autogen.sh`|
|`runbkprog`|Used by CMake to run test programs in the background|
|`switch_maint_mode`|Switches maintainer mode on/off in `configure.ac`|
|`trace`|Adds `TRACE` macros to HDF5 C library source files (run by `autogen.sh`)|
|`warnhist`|Generates compiler warning statistics for gcc/clang when fed output of make|

## TODO

* chkcopyright is currently semi-broken as it doesn't handle the full variety of copyright headers we need. We're leaving it in place, though, in the hopes that someone will update it in the future.
* Extending warnhist to better understand the output of additional compilers/languages would be nice.

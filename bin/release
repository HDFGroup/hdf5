# Make a release of hdf5.  The command-line switches are:
#
#  -d DIR	The name of the directory where the releas(es) should be
#               placed.  By default, the directory is ./releases
#
#  --nocheck	Ignore errors in MANIFEST file.
#          
# The other command-line options are the names of the programs to use
# for compressing the resulting tar archive (if none are given then
# `tar' is assumed):
#
#   tar		-- use tar and don't do any compressing.
#   compress	-- use compress and append `.Z' to the output name.
#   gzip	-- use gzip with `-9' and append `.gz' to the output name.
#   bzip2       -- use bzip2 with `-9' and append `.bz2' to the output name.
#
# Examples:
#
#   $ release
#   releases/hdf5-1.0.38.tar
#
#   $ release gzip
#   releases/hdf5-1.0.38.tar.gz
#
#   $ release -d /tmp tar compress gzip bzip2
#   /tmp/hdf5-1.0.38.tar
#   /tmp/hdf5-1.0.38.tar.Z
#   /tmp/hdf5-1.0.38.tar.gz
#   /tmp/hdf5-1.0.38.tar.bz2

# Modifications
#   Robb Matzke, 1999-07-16
#   The SunOS 5.6 sed *must* have slashes as delimiters. I changed things like
#   `sed s+/CVS++' to `sed 's/\/CVS//'
#
#   Albert Cheng, 1999-10-26
#   Moved the MANIFEST checking to a separate command file so that
#   it can be invoked individually.

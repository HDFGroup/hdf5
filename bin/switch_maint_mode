cat <<EOF

switch_maint_mode reverses the status of AM_MAINTAINER_MODE in
configure.ac from enable to disable or vice-versa. When enabled,
this feature forces the autotools to run when the input files are
older than the output files. This is the default for development
branches. When disabled, the autotools will NOT be re-run regardless
of their timestamps or any modifications. This is the default for
tarballs and release branches since it avoids having end-users
requiring the autotools.

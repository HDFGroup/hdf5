The contents of this directory are:

    COPYING     - Copyright notice
    README      - This file
    RELEASE.txt - Detailed information regarding this release
    bin/        - Directory containing HDF5 pre-compiled utilities
    include/    - Directory containing HDF5 include files
    lib/        - Directory containing HDF5 libraries and settings
    share/      - Directory containing example code in C, C++, and 
                  Fortran using HDF5 and HDF5 HL library APIs. The 
                  shell scripts provided with these examples will 
                  compile and run them, and will also test the 
                  h5cc, h5c++, and h5fc compile scripts found
                  in the installed bin directory.

These binaries were built with the ZLIB and SZIP (version 2.1, Encoder 
ENABLED) external libraries which are included in the lib directory for 
convenience.

We also provide the ZLIB and SZIP source code on our ftp server at:

   ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/

The official ZLIB and SZIP pages are at:

   ZLIB: http://www.zlib.net/
   SZIP: http://hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/

";

my $section3 = "If using the shared libraries, you must add the HDF5 library path 
to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.
";

my $section4 = "We provide scripts for compiling applications with the HDF5 libraries:

    bin/h5cc  - for C
    bin/h5fc  - for F90 (if Fortran 90 library is included with the binaries)
    bin/h5c++ - for C++ (if C++ library is included with the binaries)

After you have installed the binaries to their final destination, you can use 
these scripts (h5cc, h5fc, h5c++) to compile.  However, you must first run 
./h5redeploy in the bin directory to change site specific paths in the scripts.

You may also need to change other variables in the scripts, depending
on how things are set up on your system.  Here are some of the variables
to check:

  prefix      - Path to the HDF5 top level installation directory
  CCBASE      - Name of the C compiler
  CLINKERBASE - Name of the linker
  LIBS        - Libraries your application will link with

For further details refer to the INSTALL files in  
    ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/current/src/unpacked/release_docs/
or in the ./release_docs/ directory of the HDF5 source code, which can be found 
on the HDF Group ftp server at ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/current/src/.

contact address from http://www.hdfgroup.org/about/contact.html

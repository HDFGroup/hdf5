/* This example demonstrates debug trace output.
 *
 * Debug/trace/performance output is not tested as a regular part of our
 * testing so this program gives a quick check that it's all working.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 *
 * You need to set an environment variable named HDF5_DEBUG to have a value
 * of "+all trace ttimes".  In the bash shell, you'd use:
 *
 *      export HDF5_DEBUG="+all trace ttimes"
 *
 * When you are done with this test program, you can set the variable back
 * to "-all" to suppress trace output.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * Compile and run the test program, then inspect the output.  You should see
 * trace information for each HDF5 function call that increase over time.
 * Each time stamp is in seconds and designated with an '@' sign.  The
 * elapsed time for the function call is given in seconds in the [dt= ]
 * part.
 *
 * You will also get summary output for the shuffle filter performance and
 * data type conversion performance.  These will include the elapsed time
 * (always) and the system and user times (if available on your system).  On
 * fast machines, these numbers may be 0.0.  Adjust the loop variables in
 * the program as needed to generate reasonable output.

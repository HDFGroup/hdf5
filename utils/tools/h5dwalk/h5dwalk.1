.TH "h5dwalk" 1
.SH NAME
h5dwalk \- Provides a means of extending HDF5 tools by using parallelism on groups of files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
h5dwalk [OPTIONS] -T h5tool [H5TOOL_options...] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
h5dwalk utilizes the mpiFileUtils library to invoke a selected HDF5 tool on a collection of files.  The mpiFileUtils library provides the facilities to walk directory trees and provide a selection of files contained therein.  This selection can be filtered in various ways.  At present, h5dwalk filters the original file selection to include only HDF5 formatted files.  The resulting collection or collections can be utilized as the file inputs to the selected h5tool.

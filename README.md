RELEASE SCHEDULE
----------------

![HDF5 release schedule](doc/img/release-schedule.png) 

HDF5 does not release on a regular schedule. Instead, releases are driven by
new features and bug fixes, though we try to have at least one release of each
maintenance branch per year. Future HDF5 releases indicated on this schedule
are tentative.

| Release | New Features |
| ------- | ------------ |
| 2.0.0 | Drop Autotools support, complex number support, updated library defaults (cache sizes, etc.), semantic versioning |
| FUTURE | Multi-threaded HDF5, crashproofing / metadata journaling, Full (VFD) SWMR, encryption, digital signatures, sparse datasets, improved storage for variable-length datatypes, better Unicode support (especially on Windows) |

NOTE: In the March 2025 release we will begin using semantic versioning (https://semver.org/) and the previously announced 1.16.0 version will instead be numbered 2.0.0.

This list of feature release versions is also tentative, and the specific release
in which a feature is introduced may change.

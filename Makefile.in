##
## all:		Build libraries, header files, tests, and programs in the
##	 	various subdirectories but does not run tests or install the
##		library, header files, or programs.  The components can be
##		built individually with the targets lib, progs, and tests.
## check:	Test the uninstalled library to make sure it works. You may
##		also say `test' or `_test' (`test' doesn't work from the top
##		level directory for some versions of make because `test' is
##		also a directory).
## install:	Installs libraries, header files, programs, and documentation
##		in the various directories under the prefix directory (lib,
##		include, bin, man, info).  Use the `--prefix=PATH' option
##		to `configure' (or `config.status') or say `--help' for
##		other alternatives.  The default prefix is `/usr/local'.
## uninstall:	Delete all the installed files that the `install' target
##		created (but not the noninstalled files such as `make all'
##		created).
## clean:	Removes temporary files except those that record the
##		configuration and those that are part of the distribution.
## mostlyclean:	Like `clean' except it doesn't delete a few files like
##		libraries, programs, and/or generated header files because
##		regenerating them is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.
## distclean:	Deletes all files that are created by configuring or building
##		HDF5.  If you have unpacked the source and built HDF5 without
##		creating any other files, then `make distclean' will leave
##		only the files that were in the distrubution.
## maintainer-clean:
##		Like `distclean' except it deletes more files.  It deletes
##		all generated files.  This target is not intended for normal
##		users; it deletes files that may require special tools to
##		rebuild.
## TAGS:	Updates the tags table for this program.
## dep depend:	Builds dependencies in all subdirectories.  These targets
##		might not be available on certain combinations of make
##		programs and C compilers.  At the other extreme, the GNU
##		make used in combination with gcc will maintain dependency
##		information automatically.

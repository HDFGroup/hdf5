# Test script for the parallel flush test
#
# The parallel flush test uses two programs to test flush operations
# in parallel HDF5. The first program purposely exits without calling
# MPI_Finalize(), which is an error under the MPI standard and mpiexec
# in some implementations will return an error code even though all
# processes exit successfully. This script lets us swallow the error
# from the first program.
#
# True errors in the first program will be detected as errors in the
# second program, so watch out for that.

# Turn the $$ we use to avoid Autotools munging into $

# Allowing $$ to substitute in both the RUNPARALLEL string and the
# regexp is intentional. There doesn't seem to be a way around
# this using quote shenanigans. The downside is that there is a remote
# chance that the shell's pid will match a number in the RUNPARALLEL
# variable, but that seems less likely to cause problems than expecting
# library builders to specify two almost identical versions of the
# RUNPARALLEL command, one for use in scripts and one via Makefiles.

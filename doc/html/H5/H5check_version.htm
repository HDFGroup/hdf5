<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Library-VersCheck">H5check_version</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5check_version</code>(
            <em>unsigned</em> <code>majnum</code>,
            <em>unsigned</em> <code>minnum</code>,
            <em>unsigned</em> <code>relnum</code>
        )

<p>
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Verifies that HDF5 library versions are consistent.

<p>
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5check_version</code> verifies that the version of the HDF5
        library with which an application was compiled, as indicated by
        the passed parameters, matches the version of the HDF5 library 
        against which the application is currently linked.
        <p>
        <code>majnum</code> is the major version number of the HDF library 
        with which the application was compiled,
        <code>minnum</code> is the minor version number, and 
        <code>relnum</code> is the release number.
        Consider the following illustration:
        <dir>
            An official HDF5 release is labelled as follows:
            <br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
                HDF5 Release &lt;<code>majnum</code>&gt;<strong>.</strong>&lt;<code>minnum</code>&gt;<strong>.</strong>&lt;<code>relnum</code>&gt;
            <br>
            For example, in HDF5 Release 1.8.5:
            <ul>
                <li>1 is the major version number, <code>majnum</code>.
                <li>8 is the minor version number, <code>minnum</code>.
                <li>5 is the release number, <code>relnum</code>.
            </ul>
        </dir>  
        <p>

        As stated above,
        <code>H5check_version</code> first verifies that the version 
        of the HDF5 library with which an application was compiled 
        matches the version of the HDF5 library against which the 
        application is currently linked. 
        If this check fails, <code>H5check_version</code> causes the 
        application to abort 
        (by means of a standard C <code>abort()</code> call)
        and prints information that is usually useful for debugging.
        This precaution is is taken to avoid the risks of data corruption 
        or segmentation faults. 
        <p>
        The most common cause of this failure is that an application 
        was compiled with one version of HDF5 and is dynamically linked 
        with a different version different version.
        <p>

        If the above test passes, <code>H5check_version</code> proceeds to 
        verify the consistency of additional library version information.
        This is designed to catch source code inconsistencies that 
        do not normally cause failures;  
        if this check reveals an inconsistency, an informational warning
        is printed but the application is allowed to run.

<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a non-negative value if successful.
        Upon failure, this function causes the application to abort.

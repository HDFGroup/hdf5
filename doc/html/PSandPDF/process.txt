The PDF/PS versions of the HDF5 docs are created from scratch at each 
release from the primary version of the documentation which is 
maintained in HTML.  (Assuming, of course, that we continue to produce 
PDF/PS versions.)


1  Using MS Word (Framemaker might work even better, but I have not 
   tried it yet), open a master file that will serve as the repository 
   for gathering the document set.  This file will contain all of the 
   documents to be converted to PDF/PS.

2  Start the file off with the DocSet frontmatter.

3  Open each HTML file and copy it, placing it in proper order, into the 
   repository file.

   3a Insert Glossary.  (For R1.2, it was appended to UG and to RM.
      Alternatively, it could be inserted as a separate document.)

   3b Insert Copyright page after each title page, including after 
      DocSet title page.

4  Adjust the Styles so that type faces and font sizes are appropriate.
   (I used 10 pt New Times Roman with 9 and 10 pt supplementary fonts
   in Release 1.2.  I am considering Garamond or New Century Schoolbook
   for the next release.)

5  Create a trial PDF to make sure all of the images have been imported.

   4a Print the compiled document, selecting "Print to file".

   4b Change the .prn suffix on the output file to .ps.

   4c Convert that PostScript file to PDF with Distiller.

6  Scan the output PDF file for images.  (A visual test of the compiled 
   MS Word file online is insufficient as an image's presence on the 
   screen does not guarantee its presence in the PDF file.)

7  If any images are missing, open the appropriate HTML file in Internet
   Explorer (Netscape at the time of R1.2, did not provide this 'copy' 
   capability), right click on the image, select copy, select the 
   offending image or its placeholder in the MS Word file, and paste
   the image in.

8  Repeat 4 and 5, with variations on 6, as necessary.

9  Add headers, footers, and page numbers in the consolidated file.
   (NCSA and UIUC on inside of facing footers with page numbers on the 
   outside, release # and doc title place holder on outside of facing 
   headers.  "Different first page" so that title page can be header 
   and footer free.  

10 Once you are sure that
   -- all of the images are securely showing up in the PDF and
   -- all of the styles are as you want them,
   separate the consolidated file into separate files for each document 
   and for the DocSet frontmatter.

11 Add section break at the title page and the first page of text for 
   each document.

12 Set page numbering and finalize headers and footers (h/f).

   12a Unset "Different first page" on text section h/f.

   12b Set text section page numbering to start at 1.

   12c Set frontmatter page numbering to start at i.  (R1.2 did not
       set page numbering in frontmatter.)

13 Reset headers and footers for each document (from the initial generic 
   setting).

14 Check hyperlinks.

   14a Where reasonable (e.g., not appropriate to leave as internal link 
       for user instalation), set link as external with full DNS address.

   14b Remove internal links; reword as necessary, giving user sufficient
       clues to find info in printed docs.  (The links themselves do not
       survive the Word->PDF translation, so removing a link is generally
       as simple as removing the color/underline properties.)

15 Check and adjust pagination throughout.

   15a Each chapter (and, in some cases, major sections) begins on an 
       odd page.

   15b Watch for widows and orphans, examples and sections that start
       embarrassingly close to the bottom of the page, etc.

   15c Add enough blank pages (with no h/f) so that each document is
       printed with one completely blank sheet of paper at the back.

16 Insert a TOC into each document as appropriate.  (R1.2 went 3 or 4 
   levels deep, depending on the document.) 

17 Change Tutorial "Indes of Examples" to point to directory of Tutorial 
   examples (instead of individual links).  Keep list?

18 Do a visual scan of all docs to ensure that "everything is as it 
   should be."  (Something has probably been left out of this process 
   description!)

19 Create PDFs of each document and the DocSet frontmatter.  
   (See above.)

20 Do a visual scan of all PDFs to ensure that "everything is as it
   should be." 

21 Create a consolidated DocSet file for those who want a single file 
   containing all of the doucuments.

22 Correct errors and repeat steps as necessary.  ;>

23 Create distributable PS files by printing the PDFs "to a file"
   from Adobe Acrobat Exchange.  (This results in mush smaller PS 
   files than those generated in the above MS Word -> PS process.)

24 Post and distribute PS and PDF copies of
   -- each document and
   -- the consolidated set.

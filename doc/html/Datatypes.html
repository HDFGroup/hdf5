    <h1>The Data Type Interface (H5T)</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The data type interface provides a mechanism to describe the
      storage format of individual data points of a data set and is
      hopefully designed in such a way as to allow new features to be
      easily added without disrupting applications that use the data
      type interface.  A dataset (the H5D interface) is composed of a
      collection or raw data points of homogeneous type organized
      according to the data space (the H5S interface).

    <p>A data type is a collection of data type properties, all of
      which can be stored on disk, and which when taken as a whole,
      provide complete information for data conversion to or from that
      data type.  The interface provides functions to set and query
      properties of a data type.
      
    <p>A <em>data point</em> is an instance of a <em>data type</em>,
      which is an instance of a <em>type class</em>.  We have defined
      a set of type classes and properties which can be extended at a
      later time.  The atomic type classes are those which describe
      types which cannot be decomposed at the data type interface
      level; all other classes are compound.

    <h2>2. General Data Type Operations</h2>

    <p>The functions defined in this section operate on data types as
      a whole. New data types can be created from scratch or copied
      from existing data types.  When a data type is no longer needed
      its resources should be released by calling <code>H5Tclose()</code>.

    <p>Data types come in two flavors: named data types and transient
      data types. A named data type is stored in a file while the
      transient flavor is independent of any file. Named data types
      are always read-only, but transient types come in three
      varieties: modifiable, read-only, and immutable.  The difference 
      between read-only and immutable types is that immutable types
      cannot be closed except when the entire library is closed (the
      predefined types like <code>H5T_NATIVE_INT</code> are immutable
      transient types).

    <dl>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Tcreate (H5T_class_t <em>class</em>, size_t
	  <em>size</em>)</code>
      <dd>Data types can be created by calling this
	function, where <em>class</em> is a data type class
	identifier.  However, the only class currently allowed is
	<code>H5T_COMPOUND</code> to create a new empty compound data
	type where <em>size</em> is the total size in bytes of an
	instance of this data type.  Other data types are created with
	<code>H5Tcopy()</code>. All functions that return data type
	identifiers return a negative value for failure.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Topen (hid_t <em>location</em>, const char
	  *<em>name</em>)</code>
      <dd>A named data type can be opened by calling this function,
	which returns a data type identifier.  The identifier should
	eventually be released by calling <code>H5Tclose()</code> to
	release resources. The named data type returned by this
	function is read-only or a negative value is returned for
	failure.  The <em>location</em> is either a file or group
	identifier.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tcommit (hid_t <em>location</em>, const char
	  *<em>name</em>, hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>A transient data type (not immutable) can be committed to a
	file and turned into a named data type by calling this
	function.  The <em>location</em> is either a file or group
	identifier and when combined with <em>name</em> refers to a new
	named data type.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>hbool_t H5Tcommitted (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>A type can be queried to determine if it is a named type or
	a transient type.  If this function returns a positive value
	then the type is named (that is, it has been committed perhaps 
	by some other application).  Datasets which return committed
	data types with <code>H5Dget_type()</code> are able to share
	the data type with other datasets in the same file.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Tcopy (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>This function returns a modifiable transient data type
	which is a copy of <em>type</em> or a negative value for
	failure.  If <em>type</em> is a dataset identifier then the type
	returned is a modifiable transient copy of the data type of
	the specified dataset.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tclose (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>Releases resources associated with a data type.  The data
	type identifier should not be subsequently used since the
	results would be unpredictable.  It is illegal to close an
	immutable transient data type.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>hbool_t H5Tequal (hid_t <em>type1</em>, hid_t
	  <em>type2</em>)</code>
      <dd>Determines if two types are equal.  If <em>type1</em> and
	<em>type2</em> are the same then this function returns
	<code>TRUE</code>, otherwise it returns <code>FALSE</code> (an
	error results in a negative return value).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tlock (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>A transient data type can be locked, making it immutable
	(read-only and not closable). The library does this to all
	predefined types to prevent the application from inadvertently
	modifying or deleting (closing) them, but the application is
	also allowed to do this for its own data types.  Immutable
	data types are closed when the library closes (either by
	<code>H5close()</code> or by normal program termination).
    </dl>

    <h2>3. Properties of Atomic Types</h2>

    <p>An atomic type is a type which cannot be decomposed into
      smaller units at the API level.  All atomic types have a common
      set of properties which are augmented by properties specific to
      a particular type class.  Some of these properties also apply to
      compound data types, but we discuss them only as they apply to
      atomic data types here. The properties and the functions that
      query and set their values are:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_class_t H5Tget_class (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>This property holds one of the class names:
	<code>H5T_INTEGER, H5T_FLOAT, H5T_TIME, H5T_STRING, or
	H5T_BITFIELD</code>.  This property is read-only and is set
	when the datatype is created or copied (see
	<code>H5Tcreate()</code>, <code>H5Tcopy()</code>). If this
	function fails it returns <code>H5T_NO_CLASS</code> which has
	a negative value (all other class constants are non-negative).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_size (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_size (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>size</em>)</code>
      <dd>This property is total size of the datum in bytes, including
	padding which may appear on either side of the actual value.
	If this property is reset to a smaller value which would cause
	the significant part of the data to extend beyond the edge of
	the data type then the <code>offset</code> property is
	decremented a bit at a time.  If the offset reaches zero and
	the significant part of the data still extends beyond the edge
	of the data type then the <code>precision</code> property is
	decremented a bit at a time.  Decreasing the size of a data
	type may fail if the <code>H5T_FLOAT</code> bit fields would
	extend beyond the significant part of the type.  Adjusting the
	size of an <code>H5T_STRING</code> automatically adjusts the
	precision as well.  On error, <code>H5Tget_size()</code>
	returns zero which is never a valid size.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_order_t H5Tget_order (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_order (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_order_t
	  <em>order</em>)</code>
      <dd>All atomic data types have a byte order which describes how
	the bytes of the data type are layed out in memory.  If the
	lowest memory address contains the least significant byte of
	the datum then it is said to be <em>little-endian</em> or
	<code>H5T_ORDER_LE</code>.  If the bytes are in the oposite
	order then they are said to be <em>big-endian</em> or
	<code>H5T_ORDER_BE</code>. Some data types have the same byte
	order on all machines and are <code>H5T_ORDER_NONE</code>
	(like character strings).  If <code>H5Tget_order()</code>
	fails then it returns <code>H5T_ORDER_ERROR</code> which is a
	negative value (all successful return values are
	non-negative).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_precision (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_precision (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>precision</em>)</code>
      <dd>Some data types occupy more bytes than what is needed to
	store the value.  For instance, a <code>short</code> on a Cray
	is 32 significant bits in an eight-byte field.  The
	<code>precision</code> property identifies the number of
	significant bits of a datatype and the <code>offset</code>
	property (defined below) identifies its location.  The
	<code>size</code> property defined above represents the entire
	size (in bytes) of the data type.  If the precision is
	decreased then padding bits are inserted on the MSB side of
	the significant bits (this will fail for
	<code>H5T_FLOAT</code> types if it results in the sign,
	mantissa, or exponent bit field extending beyond the edge of
	the significant bit field).  On the other hand, if the
	precision is increased so that it "hangs over" the edge of the
	total size then the <code>offset</code> property is
	decremented a bit at a time.  If the <code>offset</code>
	reaches zero and the significant bits still hang over the
	edge, then the total size is increased a byte at a time.  The
	precision of an <code>H5T_STRING</code> is read-only and is
	always eight times the value returned by
	<code>H5Tget_size()</code>.  <code>H5Tget_precision()</code>
	returns zero on failure since zero is never a valid precision.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_offset (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_offset (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>offset</em>)</code>
      <dd>While the <code>precision</code> property defines the number
	of significant bits, the <code>offset</code> property defines
	the location of those bits within the entire datum.  The bits
	of the entire data are numbered beginning at zero at the least
	significant bit of the least significant byte (the byte at the
	lowest memory address for a little-endian type or the byte at
	the highest address for a big-endian type).  The
	<code>offset</code> property defines the bit location of the
	least signficant bit of a bit field whose length is
	<code>precision</code>.  If the offset is increased so the
	significant bits "hang over" the edge of the datum, then the
	<code>size</code> property is automatically incremented.  The
	offset is a read-only property of an <code>H5T_STRING</code>
	and is always zero.  <code>H5Tget_offset()</code> returns zero
	on failure which is also a valid offset, but is guaranteed to
	succeed if a call to <code>H5Tget_precision()</code> succeeds
	with the same arguments.
	
	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tget_pad (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_pad_t
	  *<em>lsb</em>, H5T_pad_t *<em>msb</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_pad (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_pad_t
	  <em>lsb</em>, H5T_pad_t <em>msb</em>)</code>
      <dd>The bits of a datum which are not significant as defined by
	the <code>precision</code> and <code>offset</code> properties
	are called <em>padding</em>.  Padding falls into two
	categories: padding in the low-numbered bits is <em>lsb</em>
	padding and padding in the high-numbered bits is <em>msb</em>
	padding (bits are numbered according to the description for
	the <code>offset</code> property).  Padding bits can always be
	set to zero (<code>H5T_PAD_ZERO</code>) or always set to one
	(<code>H5T_PAD_ONE</code>). The current pad types are returned
	through arguments of <code>H5Tget_pad()</code> either of which
	may be null pointers.
    </dl>

    <h3>3.1. Properties of Integer Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>Integer atomic types (<code>class=H5T_INTEGER</code>)
      describe integer number formats. Such types include the
      following information which describes the type completely and
      allows conversion between various integer atomic types.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_sign_t H5Tget_sign (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_sign (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_sign_t
	  <em>sign</em>)</code>
      <dd>Integer data can be signed two's complement
	(<code>H5T_SGN_2</code>) or unsigned
	(<code>H5T_SGN_NONE</code>). Whether data is signed or not
	becomes important when converting between two integer data
	types of differing sizes as it determines how values are
	truncated and sign extended.
    </dl>

    <h3>3.2. Properties of Floating-point Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>The library supports floating-point atomic types
      (<code>class=H5T_FLOAT</code>) as long as the bits of the
      exponent are contiguous and stored as a biased positive number,
      the bits of the mantissa are contiguous and stored as a positive
      magnitude, and a sign bit exists which is set for negative
      values.  Properties specific to floating-point types are:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tget_fields (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  *<em>spos</em>, size_t *<em>epos</em>, size_t
	  *<em>esize</em>, size_t *<em>mpos</em>, size_t
	  *<em>msize</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_fields (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>spos</em>, size_t <em>epos</em>, size_t <em>esize</em>,
	  size_t <em>mpos</em>, size_t <em>msize</em>)</code>
      <dd>A floating-point datum has bit fields which are the exponent
	and mantissa as well as a mantissa sign bit.  These properties
	define the location (bit position of least significant bit of
	the field) and size (in bits) of each field.  The bit
	positions are numbered beginning at zero at the beginning of
	the significant part of the datum (see the descriptions of the
	<code>precision</code> and <code>offset</code>
	properties). The sign bit is always of length one and none of
	the fields are allowed to overlap.  When expanding a
	floating-point type one should set the precision first; when
	decreasing the size one should set the field positions and
	sizes first.
	
	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_ebias (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_ebias (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>ebias</em>)</code>
      <dd>The exponent is stored as a non-negative value which is
	<code>ebias</code> larger than the true exponent.
	<code>H5Tget_ebias()</code> returns zero on failure which is
	also a valid exponent bias, but the function is guaranteed to
	succeed if <code>H5Tget_precision()</code> succeeds when
	called with the same arguments.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_norm_t H5Tget_norm (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_norm (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_norm_t
	  <em>norm</em>)</code>
      <dd>This property determines the normalization method of the
	mantissa.
	<ul>
	  <li>If the value is <code>H5T_NORM_MSBSET</code> then the
	    mantissa is shifted left (if non-zero) until the first bit
	    after the radix point is set and the exponent is adjusted
	    accordingly.  All bits of the mantissa after the radix
	    point are stored.

	  <li>If its value is <code>H5T_NORM_IMPLIED</code> then the
	    mantissa is shifted left (if non-zero) until the first bit
	    after the radix point is set and the exponent is adjusted
	    accordingly. The first bit after the radix point is not stored
	    since it's always set.

	  <li>If its value is <code>H5T_NORM_NONE</code> then the fractional
	    part of the mantissa is stored without normalizing it.
	</ul>

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_pad_t H5Tget_inpad (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_inpad (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_pad_t
	  <em>inpad</em>)</code>
      <dd>If any internal bits (that is, bits between the sign bit,
	the mantissa field, and the exponent field but within the
	precision field) are unused, then they will be filled
	according to the value of this property.  The <em>inpad</em>
	argument can be <code>H5T_PAD_ZERO</code> if the internal
	padding should always be set to zero, or <code>H5T_PAD_ONE</code>
	if it should always be set to one.
	<code>H5Tget_inpad()</code> returns <code>H5T_PAD_ERROR</code>
	on failure which is a negative value (successful return is
	always non-negative).
    </dl>

    <h3>3.3. Properties of Date and Time Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>Dates and times (<code>class=H5T_TIME</code>) are stored as
      character strings in one of the ISO-8601 formats like
      "<em>1997-12-05 16:25:30</em>"; as character strings using the
      Unix asctime(3) format like "<em>Thu Dec 05 16:25:30 1997</em>";
      as an integer value by juxtaposition of the year, month, and
      day-of-month, hour, minute and second in decimal like
      <em>19971205162530</em>; as an integer value in Unix time(2)
      format; or other variations.

    <h3>3.4. Properties of Character String Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>Fixed-length character string types are used to store textual
      information.  The <code>offset</code> property of a string is
      always zero and the <code>precision</code> property is eight
      times as large as the value returned by
      <code>H5Tget_size()</code> (since precision is measured in bits
      while size is measured in bytes).  Both properties are
      read-only.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_cset_t H5Tget_cset (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_cset (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_cset_t
	  <em>cset</em>)</code>
      <dd>HDF5 is able to distinguish between character sets of
	different nationalities and to convert between them to the
	extent possible.  The only character set currently supported
	is <code>H5T_CSET_ASCII</code>.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_str_t H5Tget_strpad (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_strpad (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_str_t
	  <em>strpad</em>)</code>
      <dd>The method used to store character strings differs with the
	programming language: C usually null terminates strings while
	Fortran left-justifies and space-pads strings.  This property
	defines the storage mechanism and can be

	<p>
	<dl>
	  <dt><code>H5T_STR_NULLTERM</code>
	  <dd>A C-style string which is guaranteed to be null
	    terminated.  When converting  from a longer string the
	    value will be truncated and then a null character
	    appended.

	    <br><br>
	  <dt><code>H5T_STR_NULLPAD</code>
	  <dd>A C-style string which is padded with null characters
	    but not necessarily null terminated.  Conversion from a
	    long string to a shorter <code>H5T_STR_NULLPAD</code>
	    string will truncate but not null terminate.  Conversion
	    from a short value to a longer value will append null
	    characters as with <code>H5T_STR_NULLTERM</code>.

	    <br><br>
	  <dt><code>H5T_STR_SPACEPAD</code>
	  <dd>A Fortran-style string which is padded with space
	    characters.  This is the same as
	    <code>H5T_STR_NULLPAD</code> except the padding character
	    is a space instead of a null.
	</dl>

	<p><code>H5Tget_strpad()</code> returns
	<code>H5T_STR_ERROR</code> on failure, a negative value (all
	successful return values are non-negative).
    </dl>

    <h3>3.5. Properties of Bit Field Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>Converting a bit field (<code>class=H5T_BITFIELD</code>) from
      one type to another simply copies the significant bits.  If the
      destination is smaller than the source then bits are truncated.
      Otherwise new bits are filled according to the <code>msb</code>
      padding type.

    <h3>3.6 Character and String Datatype Issues</h3>

      The <code>H5T_NATIVE_CHAR</code> and <code>H5T_NATIVE_UCHAR</code> 
      data types are actually numeric data (1-byte integers).  If the 
      application wishes to store character data, then an HDF5 
      <em>string</em> data type should be derived from 
      <code>H5T_C_S1</code> instead.

        <h4>Motivation</h4>

          HDF5 defines at least three classes of data types: 
          integer data, floating point data, and character data.  
          However, the C language defines only integer and 
          floating point data types; character data in C is 
          overloaded on the 8- or 16-bit integer types and 
          character strings are overloaded on arrays of those 
          integer types which, by convention, are terminated with 
          a zero element.

          In C, the variable <code>unsigned char s[256]</code> is 
          either an array of numeric data, a single character string 
          with at most 255 characters, or an array of 256 characters, 
          depending entirely on usage.  For uniformity with the 
          other <code>H5T_NATIVE_</code> types, HDF5 uses the 
          numeric interpretation of <code>H5T_NATIVE_CHAR</code> 
          and <code>H5T_NATIVE_UCHAR</code>.


        <h4>Usage</h4>

          To store <code>unsigned char s[256]</code> data as an 
          array of integer values, use the HDF5 data type 
          <code>H5T_NATIVE_UCHAR</code> and a data space that 
          describes the 256-element array. Some other application 
          that reads the data will then be able to read, say, a 
          256-element array of 2-byte integers and HDF5 will 
          perform the numeric translation.

          To store <code>unsigned char s[256]</code> data as a 
          character string, derive a fixed length string data type 
          from <code>H5T_C_S1</code> by increasing its size to 
          256 characters. Some other application that reads the 
          data will be able to read, say, a space padded string 
          of 16-bit characters and HDF5 will perform the character 
          and padding translations.

          <pre>
                hid_t s256 = H5Tcopy(H5T_C_S1);
                             H5Tset_size(s256, 256);
          </pre>

          To store <code>unsigned char s[256]</code> data as 
          an array of 256 ASCII characters, use an 
          HDF5 data space to describe the array and derive a 
          one-character string type from <code>H5T_C_S1</code>. 
          Some other application will be able to read a subset 
          of the array as 16-bit characters and HDF5 will 
          perform the character translations.  
          The <code>H5T_STR_NULLPAD</code> is necessary because 
          if <code>H5T_STR_NULLTERM</code> were used 
          (the default) then the single character of storage 
          would be for the null terminator and no useful data 
          would actually be stored (unless the length were 
          incremented to more than one character).

          <pre>
                hid_t s1 = H5Tcopy(H5T_C_S1);
                           H5Tset_strpad(s1, H5T_STR_NULLPAD);
          </pre>

        <h4>Summary</h4>

          The C language uses the term <code>char</code> to 
          represent one-byte numeric data and does not make 
          character strings a first-class data type.  
          HDF5 makes a distinction between integer and 
          character data and maps the C <code>signed char</code> 
          (<code>H5T_NATIVE_CHAR</code>) and 
          <code>unsigned char</code> (<code>H5T_NATIVE_UCHAR</code>) 
          data types to the HDF5 integer type class.

    <h2>4. Properties of Opaque Types</h2>

    <p>Opaque types (<code>class=H5T_OPAQUE</code>) provide the
      application with a mechanism for describing data which cannot be 
      otherwise described by HDF5. The only properties associated with 
      opaque types are a size in bytes and an ASCII tag which is
      manipulated with <code>H5Tset_tag()</code> and
      <code>H5Tget_tag()</code> functions. The library contains no
      predefined conversion functions but the application is free to
      register conversions between any two opaque types or between an
      opaque type and some other type.

    <h2>5. Properties of Compound Types</h2>

    <p>A compound data type is similar to a <code>struct</code> in C
      or a common block in Fortran: it is a collection of one or more
      atomic types or small arrays of such types.  Each
      <em>member</em> of a compound type has a name which is unique
      within that type, and a byte offset that determines the first
      byte (smallest byte address) of that member in a compound datum.
      A compound data type has the following properties:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_class_t H5Tget_class (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>All compound data types belong to the type class
      <code>H5T_COMPOUND</code>.  This property is read-only and is
      defined when a data type is created or copied (see
      <code>H5Tcreate()</code> or <code>H5Tcopy()</code>).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_size (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>Compound data types have a total size in bytes which is
	returned by this function.  All members of a compound data
	type must exist within this size.  A value of zero is returned
	for failure; all successful return values are positive.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>int H5Tget_nmembers (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>A compound data type consists of zero or more members
	(defined in any order) with unique names and which occupy
	non-overlapping regions within the datum.  In the functions
	that follow, individual members are referenced by an index
	number between zero and <em>N</em>-1, inclusive, where
	<em>N</em> is the value returned by this function.
	<code>H5Tget_nmembers()</code> returns -1 on failure.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>char *H5Tget_member_name (hid_t <em>type</em>, int
	  <em>membno</em>)</code>
      <dd>Each member has a name which is unique among its siblings in
	a compound data type.  This function returns a pointer to a
	null-terminated copy of the name allocated with
	<code>malloc()</code> or the null pointer on failure.  The
	caller is responsible for freeing the memory returned by this
	function.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_member_offset (hid_t <em>type</em>, int
	  <em>membno</em>)</code>
      <dd>The byte offset of member number <em>membno</em> with
	respect to the beginning of the containing compound datum is
	returned by this function.  A zero is returned on failure
	which is also a valid offset, but this function is guaranteed
	to succeed if a call to <code>H5Tget_member_dims()</code>
	succeeds when called with the same <em>type</em> and
	<em>membno</em> arguments.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>int H5Tget_member_dims (hid_t <em>type</em>, int
	  <em>membno</em>, int <em>dims</em>[4], int
	  <em>perm</em>[4])</code>
      <dd>Each member can be a small array of up to four dimensions,
	making it convenient to describe things like transposition
	matrices.  The dimensionality of the member is returned (or
	negative for failure) and the size in each dimension is
	returned through the <em>dims</em> argument.  The
	<em>perm</em> argument describes how the array's elements are
	mapped to the linear address space of memory with respect to
	some reference order (the reference order is specified in
	natural language documentation which describes the compound
	data type). The application which "invented" the type will
	often use the identity permutation and other applications will
	use a permutation that causes the elements to be rearranged to
	the desired order.  Only the first few elements of
	<em>dims</em> and <em>perm</em> are initialized according to
	the dimensionality of the member.  Scalar members have
	dimensionality zero.

	<b>The only permutations supported at this
	  time are the identity permutation and the transpose
	  permutation (in the 4d case, {0,1,2,3} and {3,2,1,0}).</b>

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Tget_member_type (hid_t <em>type</em>, int
	  <em>membno</em>)</code>
      <dd>Each member has its own data type, a copy of which is
	returned by this function.  The returned data type identifier
	should be released by eventually calling
	<code>H5Tclose()</code> on that type.
    </dl>

    <p>Properties of members of a compound data type are
      defined when the member is added to the compound type (see
      <code>H5Tinsert()</code>) and cannot be subsequently modified.
      This makes it imposible to define recursive data structures.

    <a name="DTypes-PredefinedAtomic">
    <h2>6. Predefined Atomic Data Types</h2>
    </a>

    <p>The library predefines a modest number of data types having
      names like <code>H5T_<em>arch</em>_<em>base</em></code> where
      <em>arch</em> is an architecture name and <em>base</em> is a
      programming type name.  New types can be derived from the
      predifined types by copying the predefined type (see
      <code>H5Tcopy()</code>) and then modifying the result.

    <h2>7. Defining Compound Data Types</h2>

    <p>Unlike atomic data types which are derived from other atomic
      data types, compound data types are created from scratch. First,
      one creates an empty compound data type and specifies it's total
      size.  Then members are added to the compound data type in any
      order.

    <p>Usually a C struct will be defined to hold a data point in
      memory, and the offsets of the members in memory will be the
      offsets of the struct members from the beginning of an instance
      of the struct.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>HOFFSET(s,m)</code>
      <dd>This macro computes the offset of member <em>m</em> within
	a struct <em>s</em>.
      <dt><code>offsetof(s,m)</code>
      <dd>This macro defined in <code>stddef.h</code> does
	exactly the same thing as the <code>HOFFSET()</code> macro.
    </dl>

    <p>Each member must have a descriptive name which is the
      key used to uniquely identify the member within the compound
      data type.  A member name in an HDF5 data type does not
      necessarily have to be the same as the name of the member in the
      C struct, although this is often the case.  Nor does one need to
      define all members of the C struct in the HDF5 compound data
      type (or vice versa).

    <p>
      <center>
	<table border align=center width="100%">
	  <caption align=bottom><h4>Example: A simple struct</h4></caption>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      <p>An HDF5 data type is created to describe complex
		numbers whose type is defined by the
		<code>complex_t</code> struct.

	      <p><code><pre>
typedef struct {
   double re;   /*real part*/
   double im;   /*imaginary part*/
} complex_t;

hid_t complex_id = H5Tcreate (H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof tmp);
H5Tinsert (complex_id, "real", HOFFSET(complex_t,re),
           H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
H5Tinsert (complex_id, "imaginary", HOFFSET(complex_t,im),
           H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
	      </pre></code>
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
      </center>

    <p>Member alignment is handled by the <code>HOFFSET</code>
      macro.  However, data stored on disk does not require alignment,
      so unaligned versions of compound data structures can be created
      to improve space efficiency on disk.  These unaligned compound
      data types can be created by computing offsets by hand to
      eliminate inter-member padding, or the members can be packed by
      calling <code>H5Tpack()</code> (which modifies a data type
      directly, so it is usually preceded by a call to
      <code>H5Tcopy()</code>):

		packed data type for disk storage may involve a higher
		data conversion cost.

		here (the typedefs are defined in the previous
		examples).

    <h2>8. <a href="DatatypesEnum.html">Enumeration Data Types</a></h2>

      An HDF5 enumeration data type is a 1:1 mapping between a set of
      symbols and a set of integer values, and an order is imposed on
      the symbols by their integer values.  The symbols are passed
      between the application and library as character strings and all
      the values for a particular enumeration type are of the same
      integer type, which is not necessarily a native type.
      <p>
      Details of enumeration data types and the related functions
      are discussed on a separate 
      <a href="DatatypesEnum.html">Enumeration Data Types</a> page.

    <h2>9. Sharing Data Types among Datasets</h2>

    <p>If a file has lots of datasets which have a common data type
      then the file could be made smaller by having all the datasets
      share a single data type.  Instead of storing a copy of the data
      type in each dataset object header, a single data type is stored
      and the object headers point to it.  The space savings is
      probably only significant for datasets with a compound data type
      since the simple data types can be described with just a few
      bytes anyway.

    <p>To create a bunch of datasets that share a single data type
      just create the datasets with a committed (named) data type.

    <p>
      <center>
	<table border align=center width="100%">
	  <caption align=bottom><h4>Example: Shared Types</h4></caption>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      <p>To create two datasets that share a common data type
		one just commits the data type, giving it a name, and
		then uses that data type to create the datasets.

	      <p><code><pre>
hid_t t1 = ...some transient type...;
H5Tcommit (file, "shared_type", t1);
hid_t dset1 = H5Dcreate (file, "dset1", t1, space, H5P_DEFAULT);
hid_t dset2 = H5Dcreate (file, "dset2", t1, space, H5P_DEFAULT);
	      </code></pre>

	      <p>And to create two additional datasets later which
		share the same type as the first two datasets:

	      <p><code><pre>
hid_t dset1 = H5Dopen (file, "dset1");
hid_t t2 = H5Dget_type (dset1);

    <h2>10. Data Conversion</h2>
    </a>

    <p>The library is capable of converting data from one type to
      another and does so automatically when reading or writing the
      raw data of a dataset, attribute data, or fill values. The
      application can also change the type of data stored in an array.

    <p>In order to insure that data conversion exceeds disk I/O rates,
      common data conversion paths can be hand-tuned and optimized for
      performance.  The library contains very efficient code for
      conversions between most native data types and a few non-native
      data types, but if a hand-tuned conversion function is not
      available, then the library falls back to a slower but more
      general conversion function.  The application programmer can
      define additional conversion functions when the libraries
      repertoire is insufficient. In fact, if an application does
      define a conversion function which would be of general interest,
      we request that the function be submitted to the HDF5
      development team for inclusion in the library.

    <p><b>Note:</b> The HDF5 library contains a deliberately limited
      set of conversion routines.  It can convert from one integer
      format to another, from one floating point format to another,
      and from one struct to another.  It can also perform byte
      swapping when the source and destination types are otherwise the
      same.  The library does not contain any functions for converting
      data between integer and floating point formats.  It is
      anticipated that some users will find it necessary to develop
      float to integer or integer to float conversion functions at the
      application level; users are invited to submit those functions
      to be considered for inclusion in future versions of the
      library.

    <p>A conversion path contains a source and destination data type
      and each path contains a <em>hard</em> conversion function
      and/or a <em>soft</em> conversion function.  The only difference
      between hard and soft functions is the way in which the library
      chooses which function applies: A hard function applies to a
      specific conversion path while a soft function may apply to
      multiple paths.  When both hard and soft functions apply to a
      conversion path, then the hard function is favored and when
      multiple soft functions apply, the one defined last is favored.

    <p>A data conversion function is of type <code>H5T_conv_t</code>
	which is defined as:

    <p>
      <code><pre>
typedef herr_t (*H5T_conv_t)(hid_t <em>src_type</em>,
                             hid_t <em>dest_type</em>,
			     H5T_cdata_t *<em>cdata</em>,
			     size_t <em>nelmts</em>,
			     void *<em>buffer</em>,
                             void *<em>background</em>);
    </pre></code>

    <p>The conversion function is called with the source and
      destination data types (<em>src_type</em> and
      <em>dst_type</em>), path-constant data (<em>cdata</em>), the
      number of instances of the data type to convert
      (<em>nelmts</em>), a buffer which initially contains an array of
      data having the source type and on return will contain an array
      of data having the destination type (<em>buffer</em>), and a
      temporary or background buffer (<em>background</em>).  Functions
      return a negative value on failure and some other value on
      success.

    <p>The <code>command</code> field of the <em>cdata</em> argument
      determines what happens within the conversion function.  It's
      values can be:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_CONV_INIT</code>
      <dd>This command is to hard conversion functions when they're
	registered or soft conversion functions when the library is
	determining if a conversion can be used for a particular path.
	The <em>src_type</em> and <em>dst_type</em> are the end-points
	of the path being queried and <em>cdata</em> is all zero.  The
	library should examine the source and destination types and
	return zero if the conversion is possible and negative
	otherwise (hard conversions need not do this since they've
	presumably been registered only on paths they support).  If
	the conversion is possible the library may allocate and
	initialize private data and assign the pointer to the
	<code>priv</code> field of <em>cdata</em> (or private data can
	be initialized later). It should also initialize the
	<code>need_bkg</code> field described below.  The <em>buf</em>
	and <em>background</em> pointers will be null pointers.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_CONV_CONV</code>
      <dd>This command indicates that data points should be converted.
	The conversion function should initialize the
	<code>priv</code> field of <em>cdata</em> if it wasn't
	initialize during the <code>H5T_CONV_INIT</code> command and
	then convert <em>nelmts</em> instances of the
	<em>src_type</em> to the <em>dst_type</em>. The
	<em>buffer</em> serves as both input and output.  The
	<em>background</em> buffer is supplied according to the value
	of the <code>need_bkg</code> field of <em>cdata</em> (the
	values are described below).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_CONV_FREE</code>
      <dd>The conversion function is about to be removed from some
	path and the private data (the
	<code><em>cdata</em>->priv</code> pointer) should be freed and
	set to null.  All other pointer arguments are null, the
	<em>src_type</em> and <em>dst_type</em> are invalid
	(negative), and the <em>nelmts</em> argument is zero.

	<br><br>
      <dt><em>Others...</em>
      <dd>Other commands might be implemented later and conversion
	functions that don't support those commands should return a
	negative value.
    </dl>


    <p>Whether a background buffer is supplied to a conversion
      function, and whether the background buffer is initialized
      depends on the value of <code><em>cdata</em>->need_bkg</code>
      which the conversion function should have initialized during the
      H5T_CONV_INIT command.  It can have one of these values:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_BKG_NONE</code>
      <dd>No background buffer will be supplied to the conversion
	function. This is the default.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_BKG_TEMP</code>
      <dd>A background buffer will be supplied but it will not be
	initialized. This is useful for those functions requiring some
	extra buffer space as the buffer can probably be allocated
	more efficiently by the library (the application can supply
	the buffer as part of the dataset transfer property list).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_BKG_YES</code>
      <dd>An initialized background buffer is passed to the conversion
	function.  The buffer is initialized with the current values
	of the destination for the data which is passed in through the
	<em>buffer</em> argument. It can be used to "fill in between
	the cracks".  For instance, if the destination type is a
	compound data type and we are initializing only part of the
	compound data type from the source type then the background
	buffer can be used to initialize the other part of the
	destination.
    </dl>

    <p>The <code>recalc</code> field of <em>cdata</em> is set when the 
      conversion path table changes. It can be used by conversion
      function that cache other conversion paths so they know when
      their cache needs to be recomputed.


    <p>Once a conversion function is written it can be registered and
      unregistered with these functions:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tregister(H5T_pers_t <em>pers</em>, const
	  char *<em>name</em>, hid_t <em>src_type</em>, hid_t
	  <em>dest_type</em>, H5T_conv_t <em>func</em>)</code>
      <dd>Once a conversion function is written, the library must be
	notified so it can be used.  The function can be registered as
	a hard (<code>H5T_PERS_HARD</code>) or soft
	(<code>H5T_PERS_SOFT</code>) conversion depending on the value
	of <em>pers</em>, displacing any previous conversions for all
	applicable paths.  The <em>name</em> is used only for
	debugging but must be supplied.  If <em>pers</em> is
	<code>H5T_PERS_SOFT</code> then only the type classes of the
	<em>src_type</em> and <em>dst_type</em> are used. For
	instance, to register a general soft conversion function that
	can be applied to any integer to integer conversion one could
	say: <code>H5Tregister(H5T_PERS_SOFT, "i2i", H5T_NATIVE_INT,
	H5T_NATIVE_INT, convert_i2i)</code>.  One special conversion
	path called the "no-op" conversion path is always defined by
	the library and used as the conversion function when no data
	transformation is necessary. The application can redefine this 
	path by specifying a new hard conversion function with a
	negative value for both the source and destination data types, 
	but the library might not call the function under certain
	circumstances.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tunregister (H5T_pers_t <em>pers</em>, const
	  char *<em>name</em>, hid_t <em>src_type</em>, hid_t
	  <em>dest_type</em>, H5T_conv_t <em>func</em>)</code>
      <dd>Any conversion path or function that matches the critera
	specified by a call to this function is removed from the type
	conversion table. All fields have the same interpretation as
	for <code>H5Tregister()</code> with the added feature that any
	(or all) may be wild cards.  The
	<code>H5T_PERS_DONTCARE</code> constant should be used to
	indicate a wild card for the <em>pers</em> argument. The wild
	card <em>name</em> is the null pointer or empty string, the
	wild card for the <em>src_type</em> and <em>dest_type</em>
	arguments is any negative value, and the wild card for the
	<em>func</em> argument is the null pointer.  The special no-op 
	conversion path is never removed by this function.

      problems we saw with AIO.  Namely, that there was a dichotomy
      between generic conversions and specific conversions that made
      it very difficult to write a conversion function that operated
      on, say, integers of any size and order as long as they don't
      have zero padding.  The AIO mechanism required such a function
      to be explicitly registered (like
      <code>H5Tregister_hard()</code>) for each an every possible
      conversion path whether that conversion path was actually used
      or not.

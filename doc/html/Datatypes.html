<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h1>The Datatype Interface (H5T)</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The datatype interface provides a mechanism to describe the
      storage format of individual data points of a data set and is
      hopefully designed in such a way as to allow new features to be
      easily added without disrupting applications that use the 
      datatype interface.  A dataset (the H5D interface) is composed of a
      collection or raw data points of homogeneous type organized
      according to the data space (the H5S interface).

    <p>A datatype is a collection of datatype properties, all of
      which can be stored on disk, and which when taken as a whole,
      provide complete information for data conversion to or from that
      datatype.  The interface provides functions to set and query
      properties of a datatype.
      
    <p>A <em>data point</em> is an instance of a <em>datatype</em>,
      which is an instance of a <em>type class</em>.  We have defined
      a set of type classes and properties which can be extended at a
      later time.  The atomic type classes are those which describe
      types which cannot be decomposed at the datatype interface
      level; all other classes are compound.

    <h2>2. General Datatype Operations</h2>

    <p>The functions defined in this section operate on datatypes as
      a whole. New datatypes can be created from scratch or copied
      from existing datatypes.  When a datatype is no longer needed
      its resources should be released by calling <code>H5Tclose()</code>.

    <p> Datatypes come in two flavors: named datatypes and transient
      datatypes. A named datatype is stored in a file while the
      transient flavor is independent of any file. Named datatypes
      are always read-only, but transient types come in three
      varieties: modifiable, read-only, and immutable.  The difference 
      between read-only and immutable types is that immutable types
      cannot be closed except when the entire library is closed (the
      predefined types like <code>H5T_NATIVE_INT</code> are immutable
      transient types).

    <dl>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Tcreate (H5T_class_t <em>class</em>, size_t
	  <em>size</em>)</code>
      <dd> Datatypes can be created by calling this
	function, where <em>class</em> is a datatype class
	identifier.  However, the only class currently allowed is
	<code>H5T_COMPOUND</code> to create a new empty compound 
	datatype where <em>size</em> is the total size in bytes of an
	instance of this datatype.  Other datatypes are created with
	<code>H5Tcopy()</code>. All functions that return datatype
	identifiers return a negative value for failure.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Topen (hid_t <em>location</em>, const char
	  *<em>name</em>)</code>
      <dd>A named datatype can be opened by calling this function,
	which returns a datatype identifier.  The identifier should
	eventually be released by calling <code>H5Tclose()</code> to
	release resources. The named datatype returned by this
	function is read-only or a negative value is returned for
	failure.  The <em>location</em> is either a file or group
	identifier.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tcommit (hid_t <em>location</em>, const char
	  *<em>name</em>, hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>A transient datatype (not immutable) can be committed to a
	file and turned into a named datatype by calling this
	function.  The <em>location</em> is either a file or group
	identifier and when combined with <em>name</em> refers to a new
	named datatype.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>htri_t H5Tcommitted (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>A type can be queried to determine if it is a named type or
	a transient type.  If this function returns a positive value
	then the type is named (that is, it has been committed perhaps 
	by some other application).  Datasets which return committed
	datatypes with <code>H5Dget_type()</code> are able to share
	the datatype with other datasets in the same file.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Tcopy (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>This function returns a modifiable transient datatype
	which is a copy of <em>type</em> or a negative value for
	failure.  If <em>type</em> is a dataset identifier then the type
	returned is a modifiable transient copy of the datatype of
	the specified dataset.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tclose (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>Releases resources associated with a datatype.  The 
	datatype identifier should not be subsequently used since the
	results would be unpredictable.  It is illegal to close an
	immutable transient datatype.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>htri_t H5Tequal (hid_t <em>type1</em>, hid_t
	  <em>type2</em>)</code>
      <dd>Determines if two types are equal.  If <em>type1</em> and
	<em>type2</em> are the same then this function returns
	<code>TRUE</code>, otherwise it returns <code>FALSE</code> (an
	error results in a negative return value).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tlock (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>A transient datatype can be locked, making it immutable
	(read-only and not closable). The library does this to all
	predefined types to prevent the application from inadvertently
	modifying or deleting (closing) them, but the application is
	also allowed to do this for its own datatypes.  Immutable
	datatypes are closed when the library closes (either by
	<code>H5close()</code> or by normal program termination).
    </dl>

    <h2>3. Properties of Atomic Types</h2>

    <p>An atomic type is a type which cannot be decomposed into
      smaller units at the API level.  All atomic types have a common
      set of properties which are augmented by properties specific to
      a particular type class.  Some of these properties also apply to
      compound datatypes, but we discuss them only as they apply to
      atomic datatypes here. The properties and the functions that
      query and set their values are:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_class_t H5Tget_class (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>This property holds one of the class names:
	<code>H5T_INTEGER, H5T_FLOAT, H5T_TIME, H5T_STRING, or
	H5T_BITFIELD</code>.  This property is read-only and is set
	when the datatype is created or copied (see
	<code>H5Tcreate()</code>, <code>H5Tcopy()</code>). If this
	function fails it returns <code>H5T_NO_CLASS</code> which has
	a negative value (all other class constants are non-negative).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_size (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_size (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>size</em>)</code>
      <dd>This property is total size of the datum in bytes, including
	padding which may appear on either side of the actual value.
	If this property is reset to a smaller value which would cause
	the significant part of the data to extend beyond the edge of
	the datatype then the <code>offset</code> property is
	decremented a bit at a time.  If the offset reaches zero and
	the significant part of the data still extends beyond the edge
	of the datatype then the <code>precision</code> property is
	decremented a bit at a time.  Decreasing the size of a 
	datatype may fail if the <code>H5T_FLOAT</code> bit fields would
	extend beyond the significant part of the type.  Adjusting the
	size of an <code>H5T_STRING</code> automatically adjusts the
	precision as well.  On error, <code>H5Tget_size()</code>
	returns zero which is never a valid size.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_order_t H5Tget_order (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_order (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_order_t
	  <em>order</em>)</code>
      <dd>All atomic datatypes have a byte order which describes how
	the bytes of the datatype are layed out in memory.  If the
	lowest memory address contains the least significant byte of
	the datum then it is said to be <em>little-endian</em> or
	<code>H5T_ORDER_LE</code>.  If the bytes are in the oposite
	order then they are said to be <em>big-endian</em> or
	<code>H5T_ORDER_BE</code>. Some datatypes have the same byte
	order on all machines and are <code>H5T_ORDER_NONE</code>
	(like character strings).  If <code>H5Tget_order()</code>
	fails then it returns <code>H5T_ORDER_ERROR</code> which is a
	negative value (all successful return values are
	non-negative).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_precision (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_precision (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>precision</em>)</code>
      <dd>Some datatypes occupy more bytes than what is needed to
	store the value.  For instance, a <code>short</code> on a Cray
	is 32 significant bits in an eight-byte field.  The
	<code>precision</code> property identifies the number of
	significant bits of a datatype and the <code>offset</code>
	property (defined below) identifies its location.  The
	<code>size</code> property defined above represents the entire
	size (in bytes) of the datatype.  If the precision is
	decreased then padding bits are inserted on the MSB side of
	the significant bits (this will fail for
	<code>H5T_FLOAT</code> types if it results in the sign,
	mantissa, or exponent bit field extending beyond the edge of
	the significant bit field).  On the other hand, if the
	precision is increased so that it "hangs over" the edge of the
	total size then the <code>offset</code> property is
	decremented a bit at a time.  If the <code>offset</code>
	reaches zero and the significant bits still hang over the
	edge, then the total size is increased a byte at a time.  The
	precision of an <code>H5T_STRING</code> is read-only and is
	always eight times the value returned by
	<code>H5Tget_size()</code>.  <code>H5Tget_precision()</code>
	returns zero on failure since zero is never a valid precision.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_offset (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_offset (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>offset</em>)</code>
      <dd>While the <code>precision</code> property defines the number
	of significant bits, the <code>offset</code> property defines
	the location of those bits within the entire datum.  The bits
	of the entire data are numbered beginning at zero at the least
	significant bit of the least significant byte (the byte at the
	lowest memory address for a little-endian type or the byte at
	the highest address for a big-endian type).  The
	<code>offset</code> property defines the bit location of the
	least signficant bit of a bit field whose length is
	<code>precision</code>.  If the offset is increased so the
	significant bits "hang over" the edge of the datum, then the
	<code>size</code> property is automatically incremented.  The
	offset is a read-only property of an <code>H5T_STRING</code>
	and is always zero.  <code>H5Tget_offset()</code> returns zero
	on failure which is also a valid offset, but is guaranteed to
	succeed if a call to <code>H5Tget_precision()</code> succeeds
	with the same arguments.
	
	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tget_pad (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_pad_t
	  *<em>lsb</em>, H5T_pad_t *<em>msb</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_pad (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_pad_t
	  <em>lsb</em>, H5T_pad_t <em>msb</em>)</code>
      <dd>The bits of a datum which are not significant as defined by
	the <code>precision</code> and <code>offset</code> properties
	are called <em>padding</em>.  Padding falls into two
	categories: padding in the low-numbered bits is <em>lsb</em>
	padding and padding in the high-numbered bits is <em>msb</em>
	padding (bits are numbered according to the description for
	the <code>offset</code> property).  Padding bits can always be
	set to zero (<code>H5T_PAD_ZERO</code>) or always set to one
	(<code>H5T_PAD_ONE</code>). The current pad types are returned
	through arguments of <code>H5Tget_pad()</code> either of which
	may be null pointers.
    </dl>

    <h3>3.1. Properties of Integer Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>Integer atomic types (<code>class=H5T_INTEGER</code>)
      describe integer number formats. Such types include the
      following information which describes the type completely and
      allows conversion between various integer atomic types.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_sign_t H5Tget_sign (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_sign (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_sign_t
	  <em>sign</em>)</code>
      <dd>Integer data can be signed two's complement
	(<code>H5T_SGN_2</code>) or unsigned
	(<code>H5T_SGN_NONE</code>). Whether data is signed or not
	becomes important when converting between two integer 
	datatypes of differing sizes as it determines how values are
	truncated and sign extended.
    </dl>

    <h3>3.2. Properties of Floating-point Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>The library supports floating-point atomic types
      (<code>class=H5T_FLOAT</code>) as long as the bits of the
      exponent are contiguous and stored as a biased positive number,
      the bits of the mantissa are contiguous and stored as a positive
      magnitude, and a sign bit exists which is set for negative
      values.  Properties specific to floating-point types are:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tget_fields (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  *<em>spos</em>, size_t *<em>epos</em>, size_t
	  *<em>esize</em>, size_t *<em>mpos</em>, size_t
	  *<em>msize</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_fields (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>spos</em>, size_t <em>epos</em>, size_t <em>esize</em>,
	  size_t <em>mpos</em>, size_t <em>msize</em>)</code>
      <dd>A floating-point datum has bit fields which are the exponent
	and mantissa as well as a mantissa sign bit.  These properties
	define the location (bit position of least significant bit of
	the field) and size (in bits) of each field.  The bit
	positions are numbered beginning at zero at the beginning of
	the significant part of the datum (see the descriptions of the
	<code>precision</code> and <code>offset</code>
	properties). The sign bit is always of length one and none of
	the fields are allowed to overlap.  When expanding a
	floating-point type one should set the precision first; when
	decreasing the size one should set the field positions and
	sizes first.
	
	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_ebias (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_ebias (hid_t <em>type</em>, size_t
	  <em>ebias</em>)</code>
      <dd>The exponent is stored as a non-negative value which is
	<code>ebias</code> larger than the true exponent.
	<code>H5Tget_ebias()</code> returns zero on failure which is
	also a valid exponent bias, but the function is guaranteed to
	succeed if <code>H5Tget_precision()</code> succeeds when
	called with the same arguments.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_norm_t H5Tget_norm (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_norm (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_norm_t
	  <em>norm</em>)</code>
      <dd>This property determines the normalization method of the
	mantissa.
	<ul>
	  <li>If the value is <code>H5T_NORM_MSBSET</code> then the
	    mantissa is shifted left (if non-zero) until the first bit
	    after the radix point is set and the exponent is adjusted
	    accordingly.  All bits of the mantissa after the radix
	    point are stored.

	  <li>If its value is <code>H5T_NORM_IMPLIED</code> then the
	    mantissa is shifted left (if non-zero) until the first bit
	    after the radix point is set and the exponent is adjusted
	    accordingly. The first bit after the radix point is not stored
	    since it's always set.

	  <li>If its value is <code>H5T_NORM_NONE</code> then the fractional
	    part of the mantissa is stored without normalizing it.
	</ul>

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_pad_t H5Tget_inpad (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_inpad (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_pad_t
	  <em>inpad</em>)</code>
      <dd>If any internal bits (that is, bits between the sign bit,
	the mantissa field, and the exponent field but within the
	precision field) are unused, then they will be filled
	according to the value of this property.  The <em>inpad</em>
	argument can be <code>H5T_PAD_ZERO</code> if the internal
	padding should always be set to zero, or <code>H5T_PAD_ONE</code>
	if it should always be set to one.
	<code>H5Tget_inpad()</code> returns <code>H5T_PAD_ERROR</code>
	on failure which is a negative value (successful return is
	always non-negative).
    </dl>

    <h3>3.3. Properties of Date and Time Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>Dates and times (<code>class=H5T_TIME</code>) are stored as
      character strings in one of the ISO-8601 formats like
      "<em>1997-12-05 16:25:30</em>"; as character strings using the
      Unix asctime(3) format like "<em>Thu Dec 05 16:25:30 1997</em>";
      as an integer value by juxtaposition of the year, month, and
      day-of-month, hour, minute and second in decimal like
      <em>19971205162530</em>; as an integer value in Unix time(2)
      format; or other variations.

      <p><i>Note that the above time datatype representation has not 
         been fully implemented and that the time datatype,
         <code>H5T_TIME</code>, is not fully supported in the current
         version of the HDF5 Library.
         (Note added on 6 February 2006.)</i>

    <h3>3.4. Properties of Character String Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>Fixed-length character string types are used to store textual
      information.  The <code>offset</code> property of a string is
      always zero and the <code>precision</code> property is eight
      times as large as the value returned by
      <code>H5Tget_size()</code> (since precision is measured in bits
      while size is measured in bytes).  Both properties are
      read-only.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_cset_t H5Tget_cset (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_cset (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_cset_t
	  <em>cset</em>)</code>
      <dd>HDF5 is able to distinguish between character sets of
	different nationalities and to convert between them to the
	extent possible.  The only character set currently supported
	is <code>H5T_CSET_ASCII</code>.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_str_t H5Tget_strpad (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tset_strpad (hid_t <em>type</em>, H5T_str_t
	  <em>strpad</em>)</code>
      <dd>The method used to store character strings differs with the
	programming language: C usually null terminates strings while
	Fortran left-justifies and space-pads strings.  This property
	defines the storage mechanism and can be

	<p>
	<dl>
	  <dt><code>H5T_STR_NULLTERM</code>
	  <dd>A C-style string which is guaranteed to be null
	    terminated.  When converting  from a longer string the
	    value will be truncated and then a null character
	    appended.

	    <br><br>
	  <dt><code>H5T_STR_NULLPAD</code>
	  <dd>A C-style string which is padded with null characters
	    but not necessarily null terminated.  Conversion from a
	    long string to a shorter <code>H5T_STR_NULLPAD</code>
	    string will truncate but not null terminate.  Conversion
	    from a short value to a longer value will append null
	    characters as with <code>H5T_STR_NULLTERM</code>.

	    <br><br>
	  <dt><code>H5T_STR_SPACEPAD</code>
	  <dd>A Fortran-style string which is padded with space
	    characters.  This is the same as
	    <code>H5T_STR_NULLPAD</code> except the padding character
	    is a space instead of a null.
	</dl>

	<p><code>H5Tget_strpad()</code> returns
	<code>H5T_STR_ERROR</code> on failure, a negative value (all
	successful return values are non-negative).
    </dl>

    <h3>3.5. Properties of Bit Field Atomic Types</h3>

    <p>Converting a bit field (<code>class=H5T_BITFIELD</code>) from
      one type to another simply copies the significant bits.  If the
      destination is smaller than the source then bits are truncated.
      Otherwise new bits are filled according to the <code>msb</code>
      padding type.

    <h3>3.6. Character and String Datatype Issues</h3>

      The <code>H5T_NATIVE_CHAR</code> and <code>H5T_NATIVE_UCHAR</code> 
      datatypes are actually numeric data (1-byte integers).  If the 
      application wishes to store character data, then an HDF5 
      <em>string</em> datatype should be derived from 
      <code>H5T_C_S1</code> instead.

        <h4>Motivation</h4>

          HDF5 defines at least three classes of datatypes: 
          integer data, floating point data, and character data.  
          However, the C language defines only integer and 
          floating point datatypes; character data in C is 
          overloaded on the 8- or 16-bit integer types and 
          character strings are overloaded on arrays of those 
          integer types which, by convention, are terminated with 
          a zero element.

          In C, the variable <code>unsigned char s[256]</code> is 
          either an array of numeric data, a single character string 
          with at most 255 characters, or an array of 256 characters, 
          depending entirely on usage.  For uniformity with the 
          other <code>H5T_NATIVE_</code> types, HDF5 uses the 
          numeric interpretation of <code>H5T_NATIVE_CHAR</code> 
          and <code>H5T_NATIVE_UCHAR</code>.


        <h4>Usage</h4>

          To store <code>unsigned char s[256]</code> data as an 
          array of integer values, use the HDF5 datatype 
          <code>H5T_NATIVE_UCHAR</code> and a data space that 
          describes the 256-element array. Some other application 
          that reads the data will then be able to read, say, a 
          256-element array of 2-byte integers and HDF5 will 
          perform the numeric translation.

          To store <code>unsigned char s[256]</code> data as a 
          character string, derive a fixed length string datatype 
          from <code>H5T_C_S1</code> by increasing its size to 
          256 characters. Some other application that reads the 
          data will be able to read, say, a space padded string 
          of 16-bit characters and HDF5 will perform the character 
          and padding translations.

          <pre>
                hid_t s256 = H5Tcopy(H5T_C_S1);
                             H5Tset_size(s256, 256);
          </pre>

          To store <code>unsigned char s[256]</code> data as 
          an array of 256 ASCII characters, use an 
          HDF5 data space to describe the array and derive a 
          one-character string type from <code>H5T_C_S1</code>. 
          Some other application will be able to read a subset 
          of the array as 16-bit characters and HDF5 will 
          perform the character translations.  
          The <code>H5T_STR_NULLPAD</code> is necessary because 
          if <code>H5T_STR_NULLTERM</code> were used 
          (the default) then the single character of storage 
          would be for the null terminator and no useful data 
          would actually be stored (unless the length were 
          incremented to more than one character).

          <pre>
                hid_t s1 = H5Tcopy(H5T_C_S1);
                           H5Tset_strpad(s1, H5T_STR_NULLPAD);
          </pre>

        <h4>Summary</h4>

          The C language uses the term <code>char</code> to 
          represent one-byte numeric data and does not make 
          character strings a first-class datatype.  
          HDF5 makes a distinction between integer and 
          character data and maps the C <code>signed char</code> 
          (<code>H5T_NATIVE_CHAR</code>) and 
          <code>unsigned char</code> (<code>H5T_NATIVE_UCHAR</code>) 
          datatypes to the HDF5 integer type class.

    <h2>4. Properties of Opaque Types</h2>

    <p>Opaque types (<code>class=H5T_OPAQUE</code>) provide the
      application with a mechanism for describing data which cannot be 
      otherwise described by HDF5. The only properties associated with 
      opaque types are a size in bytes and an ASCII tag which is
      manipulated with <code>H5Tset_tag()</code> and
      <code>H5Tget_tag()</code> functions. The library contains no
      predefined conversion functions but the application is free to
      register conversions between any two opaque types or between an
      opaque type and some other type.

    <h2>5. Properties of Compound Types</h2>

    <p>A compound datatype is similar to a <code>struct</code> in C
      or a common block in Fortran: it is a collection of one or more
      atomic types or small arrays of such types.  Each
      <em>member</em> of a compound type has a name which is unique
      within that type, and a byte offset that determines the first
      byte (smallest byte address) of that member in a compound datum.
      A compound datatype has the following properties:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_class_t H5Tget_class (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>All compound datatypes belong to the type class
      <code>H5T_COMPOUND</code>.  This property is read-only and is
      defined when a datatype is created or copied (see
      <code>H5Tcreate()</code> or <code>H5Tcopy()</code>).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_size (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>Compound datatypes have a total size in bytes which is
	returned by this function.  All members of a compound 
	datatype must exist within this size.  A value of zero is returned
	for failure; all successful return values are positive.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>int H5Tget_nmembers (hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>A compound datatype consists of zero or more members
	(defined in any order) with unique names and which occupy
	non-overlapping regions within the datum.  In the functions
	that follow, individual members are referenced by an index
	number between zero and <em>N</em>-1, inclusive, where
	<em>N</em> is the value returned by this function.
	<code>H5Tget_nmembers()</code> returns -1 on failure.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>char *H5Tget_member_name (hid_t <em>type</em>, unsigned
	  <em>membno</em>)</code>
      <dd>Each member has a name which is unique among its siblings in
	a compound datatype.  This function returns a pointer to a
	null-terminated copy of the name allocated with
	<code>malloc()</code> or the null pointer on failure.  The
	caller is responsible for freeing the memory returned by this
	function.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>size_t H5Tget_member_offset (hid_t <em>type</em>, unsigned
	  <em>membno</em>)</code>
      <dd>The byte offset of member number <em>membno</em> with
	respect to the beginning of the containing compound datum is
	returned by this function.  A zero is returned on failure
	which is also a valid offset, but this function is guaranteed
	to succeed if a call to <code>H5Tget_member_class()</code>
	succeeds when called with the same <em>type</em> and
	<em>membno</em> arguments.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Tget_member_type (hid_t <em>type</em>, unsigned
	  <em>membno</em>)</code>
      <dd>Each member has its own datatype, a copy of which is
	returned by this function.  The returned datatype identifier
	should be released by eventually calling
	<code>H5Tclose()</code> on that type.
    </dl>

    <p>Properties of members of a compound datatype are
      defined when the member is added to the compound type (see
      <code>H5Tinsert()</code>) and cannot be subsequently modified.
      This makes it imposible to define recursive data structures.


    <a name="DTypes-PredefinedAtomic">
    <h2>6. Predefined Atomic Datatypes</h2>
    </a>

    <p>The library predefines a modest number of datatypes having
      names like <code>H5T_<em>arch</em>_<em>base</em></code> where
      <em>arch</em> is an architecture name and <em>base</em> is a

      predifined types by copying the predefined type (see
      <code>H5Tcopy()</code>) and then modifying the result.

    <h2>7. Defining Compound Datatypes</h2>

    <p>Unlike atomic datatypes which are derived from other atomic
      datatypes, compound datatypes are created from scratch. First,
      one creates an empty compound datatype and specifies it's total
      size.  Then members are added to the compound datatype in any
      order.

    <p>Usually a C struct will be defined to hold a data point in
      memory, and the offsets of the members in memory will be the
      offsets of the struct members from the beginning of an instance
      of the struct.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>HOFFSET(s,m)</code>
      <dd>This macro computes the offset of member <em>m</em> within
	a struct <em>s</em>.
      <dt><code>offsetof(s,m)</code>
      <dd>This macro defined in <code>stddef.h</code> does
	exactly the same thing as the <code>HOFFSET()</code> macro.
    </dl>

    <p>Each member must have a descriptive name which is the
      key used to uniquely identify the member within the compound
      datatype.  A member name in an HDF5 datatype does not
      necessarily have to be the same as the name of the member in the
      C struct, although this is often the case.  Nor does one need to
      define all members of the C struct in the HDF5 compound 
      datatype (or vice versa).

    <p>
      <center>
	<table border align=center width="100%">
	  <caption align=bottom><h4>Example: A simple struct</h4></caption>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      <p>An HDF5 datatype is created to describe complex
		numbers whose type is defined by the
		<code>complex_t</code> struct.

	      <p><code><pre>
typedef struct {
   double re;   /*real part*/
   double im;   /*imaginary part*/
} complex_t;

hid_t complex_id = H5Tcreate (H5T_COMPOUND, sizeof tmp);
H5Tinsert (complex_id, "real", HOFFSET(complex_t,re),
           H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
H5Tinsert (complex_id, "imaginary", HOFFSET(complex_t,im),
           H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE);
	      </pre></code>
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
      </center>

    <p>Member alignment is handled by the <code>HOFFSET</code>
      macro.  However, data stored on disk does not require alignment,
      so unaligned versions of compound data structures can be created
      to improve space efficiency on disk.  These unaligned compound
      datatypes can be created by computing offsets by hand to
      eliminate inter-member padding, or the members can be packed by
      calling <code>H5Tpack()</code> (which modifies a datatype
      directly, so it is usually preceded by a call to
      <code>H5Tcopy()</code>):

		architecture being used.  Note also that using a
		packed datatype for disk storage may involve a higher
		data conversion cost.

    <h2>8. Enumeration Datatypes</h2>

    <h3>8.1. Introduction</h3>

    <p>An HDF enumeration datatype is a 1:1 mapping between a set of
      symbols and a set of integer values, and an order is imposed on
      the symbols by their integer values.  The symbols are passed
      between the application and library as character strings and all
      the values for a particular enumeration type are of the same
      integer type, which is not necessarily a native type.

    <h3>8.2. Creation</h3>
    
    <p>Creation of an enumeration datatype resembles creation of a
      compound datatype: first an empty enumeration type is created,
      then members are added to the type, then the type is optionally
      locked.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Tcreate(H5T_class_t <em>type_class</em>,
	  size_t <em>size</em>)</code>
      <dd>This function creates a new empty enumeration datatype based 
	on a native signed integer type. The first argument is the
	constant <code>H5T_ENUM</code> and the second argument is the
	size in bytes of the native integer on which the enumeration
	type is based. If the architecture does not support a native
	signed integer of the specified size then an error is
	returned.

	<pre>
/* Based on a native signed short */
hid_t hdf_en_colors = H5Tcreate(H5T_ENUM, sizeof(short));</pre>


      <dt><code>hid_t H5Tenum_create(hid_t <em>base</em>)</code>
      <dd>This function creates a new empty enumeration datatype based 
	on some integer datatype <em>base</em> and is a
	generalization of the <code>H5Tcreate()</code> function.  This 
	function is useful when creating an enumeration type based on
	some non-native integer datatype, but it can be used for
	native types as well.

	<pre>
/* Based on a native unsigned short */
hid_t hdf_en_colors_1 = H5Tenum_create(H5T_NATIVE_USHORT);

/* Based on a MIPS 16-bit unsigned integer */
hid_t hdf_en_colors_2 = H5Tenum_create(H5T_MIPS_UINT16);

/* Based on a big-endian 16-bit unsigned integer */
hid_t hdf_en_colors_3 = H5Tenum_create(H5T_STD_U16BE);</pre>


      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tenum_insert(hid_t <em>etype</em>, const char
	  *<em>symbol</em>, void *<em>value</em>)</code>
      <dd>Members are inserted into the enumeration datatype
	<em>etype</em> with this function.  Each member has a symbolic 
	name <em>symbol</em> and some integer representation
	<em>value</em>.  The <em>value</em> argument must point to a value
	of the same datatype as specified when the enumeration type
	was created. The order of member insertion is not important
	but all symbol names and values must be unique within a
	particular enumeration type.

	<pre>
short val;
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "RED",   (val=0,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "GREEN", (val=1,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "BLUE",  (val=2,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "WHITE", (val=3,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "BLACK", (val=4,&amp;val));</pre>


      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tlock(hid_t <em>etype</em>)</code>
      <dd>This function locks a datatype so it cannot be modified or
	freed unless the entire HDF5 library is closed.  Its use is
	completely optional but using it on an application datatype
	makes that datatype act like a predefined datatype.

	<pre>
H5Tlock(hdf_en_colors);</pre>

    </dl>

    <h3>8.3. Integer Operations</h3>

    <p>Because an enumeration datatype is derived from an integer
      datatype, any operation which can be performed on integer 
      datatypes can also be performed on enumeration datatypes.  This
      includes:

    <p>
      <center>
	  <table>
	    <tr>
	      <td><code>H5Topen()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tcreate()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tcopy()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tclose()</code></td>
	    </tr><tr>
	      <td><code>H5Tequal()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tlock()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tcommit()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tcommitted()</code></td>
	    </tr><tr>
	      <td><code>H5Tget_class()</code></td>

	      <td><code>H5Tget_order()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tget_pad()</code></td>
	    </tr><tr>
	      <td><code>H5Tget_precision()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tget_offset()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tget_sign()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tset_size()</code></td>
	    </tr><tr>
	      <td><code>H5Tset_order()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tset_precision()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tset_offset()</code></td>
	      <td><code>H5Tset_pad()</code></td>
	    </tr><tr>
	      <td><code>H5Tset_sign()</code></td>
	    </tr>
	  </table>
      </center>

    <p>In addition, the new function <code>H5Tget_super()</code> will
      be defined for all datatypes that are derived from existing
      types (currently just enumeration types).

    <dl>
      <dt><code>hid_t H5Tget_super(hid_t <em>type</em>)</code>
      <dd>Return the datatype from which <em>type</em> is
	derived. When <em>type</em> is an enumeration datatype then
	the returned value will be an integer datatype but not
	necessarily a native type.  One use of this function would be
	to create a new enumeration type based on the same underlying
	integer type and values but with possibly different symbols.

	<pre>
hid_t itype = H5Tget_super(hdf_en_colors);
hid_t hdf_fr_colors = H5Tenum_create(itype);
H5Tclose(itype);

short val;
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_fr_colors, "ouge",  (val=0,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_fr_colors, "vert",  (val=1,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_fr_colors, "bleu",  (val=2,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_fr_colors, "blanc", (val=3,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_fr_colors, "noir",  (val=4,&amp;val));
H5Tlock(hdf_fr_colors);</pre>
    </dl>

    <h3>8.4. Type Functions</h3>

    <p>A small set of functions is available for querying properties
      of an enumeration type.  These functions are likely to be used
      by browsers to display datatype information.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>int H5Tget_nmembers(hid_t <em>etype</em>)</code>
      <dd>When given an enumeration datatype <em>etype</em> this
	function returns the number of members defined for that
	type. This function is already implemented for compound 
	datatypes.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>char *H5Tget_member_name(hid_t <em>etype</em>, unsigned
	  <em>membno</em>)</code>
      <dd>Given an enumeration datatype <em>etype</em> this function
	returns the symbol name for the member indexed by
	<em>membno</em>. Members are numbered from zero to
	<em>N</em>-1 where <em>N</em> is the return value from
	<code>H5Tget_nmembers()</code>. The members are stored in no
	particular order.  This function is already implemented for
	compound datatypes.  If an error occurs then the null pointer 
	is returned.  The return value should be freed by calling
	<code>free()</code>.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tget_member_value(hid_t <em>etype</em>, unsigned
	  <em>membno</em>, void *<em>value</em>/*out*/)</code>
      <dd>Given an enumeration datatype <em>etype</em> this function
	returns the value associated with the member indexed by
	<em>membno</em> (as described for
	<code>H5Tget_member_name()</code>). The value returned
	is in the domain of the underlying integer
	datatype which is often a native integer type. The
	application should ensure that the memory pointed to by
	<em>value</em> is large enough to contain the result (the size 
	can be obtained by calling <code>H5Tget_size()</code> on
	either the enumeration type or the underlying integer type
	when the type is not known by the C compiler.

	<pre>
int n = H5Tget_nmembers(hdf_en_colors);
unsigned u;
for (u=0; u&lt;(unsigned)n; u++) {
    char *symbol = H5Tget_member_name(hdf_en_colors, u);
    short val;
    H5Tget_member_value(hdf_en_colors, u, &amp;val);
    printf("#%u %20s = %d\n", u, symbol, val);
    free(symbol);
}</pre>

	  <p>
          Output:
	  <pre>
#0                BLACK = 4
#1                 BLUE = 2
#2                GREEN = 1
#3                  RED = 0
#4                WHITE = 3</pre>
    </dl>

    <h3>8.5. Data Functions</h3>

    <p>In addition to querying about the enumeration type properties,
      an application may want to make queries about enumerated
      data. These functions perform efficient mappings between symbol
      names and values.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tenum_valueof(hid_t <em>etype</em>, const char 
	  *<em>symbol</em>, void *<em>value</em>/*out*/)</code>
      <dd>Given an enumeration datatype <em>etype</em> this function
      returns through <em>value</em> the bit pattern associated with
      the symbol name <em>symbol</em>.  The <em>value</em> argument
      should point to memory which is large enough to hold the result, 
      which is returned as the underlying integer datatype specified
      when the enumeration type was created, often a native integer
      type.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tenum_nameof(hid_t <em>etype</em>, void
	  *<em>value</em>, char *<em>symbol</em>, size_t
	  <em>size</em>)</code>
      <dd>This function translates a bit pattern pointed to by
	<em>value</em> to a symbol name according to the mapping
	defined in the enumeration datatype <em>etype</em> and stores
	at most <em>size</em> characters of that name (counting the
	null terminator) to the <em>symbol</em> buffer. If the name is 
	longer than the result buffer then the result is not null
	terminated and the function returns failure. If <em>value</em> 
	points to a bit pattern which is not in the domain of the
	enumeration type then the first byte of the <em>symbol</em>
	buffer is set to zero and the function fails.

	<pre>
short data[1000] = {4, 2, 0, 0, 5, 1, ...};
int i;
char symbol[32];

for (i=0; i&lt;1000; i++) {
    if (H5Tenum_nameof(hdf_en_colors, data+i, symbol,
                       sizeof symbol))&lt;0) {
        if (symbol[0]) {
            strcpy(symbol+sizeof(symbol)-4, "...");
        } else {
            strcpy(symbol, "UNKNOWN");
        }
    }
    printf("%d %s\n", data[i], symbol);
}
printf("}\n");</pre>

	  <p>
          Output:
	  <pre>
4 BLACK
2 BLUE
0 RED
0 RED
5 UNKNOWN
1 GREEN
...</pre>
    </dl>

    <h3>8.6. Conversion</h3>

    <p>Enumerated data can be converted from one type to another
      provided the destination enumeration type contains all the
      symbols of the source enumeration type. The conversion operates
      by matching up the symbol names of the source and destination
      enumeration types to build a mapping from source value to
      destination value.  For instance, if we are translating from an
      enumeration type that defines a sequence of integers as the
      values for the colors to a type that defines a different bit for 
      each color then the mapping might look like this:

    <p><img src="EnumMap.gif" alt="Enumeration Mapping">

    <p>That is, a source value of <code>2</code> which corresponds to
      <code>BLUE</code> would be mapped to <code>0x0004</code>. The
      following code snippet builds the second datatype, then
      converts a raw data array from one datatype to another, and
      then prints the result.

      <pre>
/* Create a new enumeration type */
short val;
hid_t bits = H5Tcreate(H5T_ENUM, sizeof val);
H5Tenum_insert(bits, "RED",   (val=0x0001,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(bits, "GREEN", (val=0x0002,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(bits, "BLUE",  (val=0x0004,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(bits, "WHITE", (val=0x0008,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(bits, "BLACK", (val=0x0010,&amp;val));

/* The data */
short data[6] = {1, 4, 2, 0, 3, 5};

/* Convert the data from one type to another */
H5Tconvert(hdf_en_colors, bits, 5, data, NULL, plist_id);

/* Print the data */
for (i=0; i&lt;6; i++) {
    printf("0x%04x\n", (unsigned)(data[i]));
}</pre>

        <p>
        Output:
	<pre>

0x0002
0x0010
0x0004
0x0001
0x0008
0xffff</pre>

    <p>If the source data stream contains values which are not in the
      domain of the conversion map then an overflow exception is
      raised within the library, causing the application defined
      overflow handler to be invoked (see
      <code>H5Tset_overflow()</code>). If no overflow handler is
      defined then all bits of the destination value will be set.

    <p>The HDF library will not provide conversions between enumerated 
      data and integers although the application is free to do so
      (this is a policy we apply to all classes of HDF datatypes). 
      However, since enumeration types are derived from
      integer types it is permissible to treat enumerated data as
      integers and perform integer conversions in that context.

    <h3>8.7. Symbol Order</h3>

    <p>Symbol order is determined by the integer values associated
      with each symbol.  When the integer datatype is a native type,
      testing the relative order of two symbols is an easy process:
      simply compare the values of the symbols.  If only the symbol
      names are available then the values must first be determined by
      calling <code>H5Tenum_valueof()</code>.

      <pre>
short val1, val2;
H5Tenum_valueof(hdf_en_colors, "WHITE", &amp;val1);
H5Tenum_valueof(hdf_en_colors, "BLACK", &amp;val2);
if (val1 &lt; val2) ...</pre>

    <p>When the underlying integer datatype is not a native type then 
      the easiest way to compare symbols is to first create a similar
      enumeration type that contains all the same symbols but has a
      native integer type (HDF type conversion features can be used to
      convert the non-native values to native values). Once we have a
      native type we can compare symbol order as just described.  If
      <code>foreign</code> is some non-native enumeration type then a
      native type can be created as follows:

      <pre>
int n = H5Tget_nmembers(foreign);
hid_t itype = H5Tget_super(foreign);
void *val = malloc(n * MAX(H5Tget_size(itype), sizeof(int)));
char *name = malloc(n * sizeof(char*));
unsigned u;

/* Get foreign type information */
for (u=0; u&lt;(unsigned)n; u++) {
    name[u] = H5Tget_member_name(foreign, u);
    H5Tget_member_value(foreign, u,
                        (char*)val+u*H5Tget_size(foreign));
}

/* Convert integer values to new type */
H5Tconvert(itype, H5T_NATIVE_INT, n, val, NULL, plist_id);

/* Build a native type */
hid_t native = H5Tenum_create(H5T_NATIVE_INT);
for (i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {
    H5Tenum_insert(native, name[i], ((int*)val)[i]);
    free(name[i]);
}
free(name);
free(val);</pre>

    <p>It is also possible to convert enumerated data to a new type
      that has a different order defined for the symbols.  For
      instance, we can define a new type, <code>reverse</code> that
      defines the same five colors but in the reverse order.

      <pre>
short val;
int i;
char sym[8];
short data[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};

hid_t reverse = H5Tenum_create(H5T_NATIVE_SHORT);
H5Tenum_insert(reverse, "BLACK", (val=0,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(reverse, "WHITE", (val=1,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(reverse, "BLUE",  (val=2,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(reverse, "GREEN", (val=3,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(reverse, "RED",   (val=4,&amp;val));

/* Print data */
for (i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {
    H5Tenum_nameof(hdf_en_colors, data+i, sym, sizeof sym);
    printf ("%d %s\n", data[i], sym);
}

puts("Converting...");
H5Tconvert(hdf_en_colors, reverse, 5, data, NULL, plist_id);

/* Print data */
for (i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {
    H5Tenum_nameof(reverse, data+i, sym, sizeof sym);
    printf ("%d %s\n", data[i], sym);
}</pre>
	
      <p>
      Output:
      <pre>
0 RED
1 GREEN
2 BLUE
3 WHITE
4 BLACK
Converting...
4 RED
3 GREEN
2 BLUE
1 WHITE
0 BLACK</pre>

    <h3>8.8. Equality</h3>

    <p>The order that members are inserted into an enumeration type is 
      unimportant; the important part is the associations between the
      symbol names and the values.  Thus, two enumeration datatypes
      will be considered equal if and only if both types have the same
      symbol/value associations and both have equal underlying integer
      datatypes. Type equality is tested with the
      <code>H5Tequal()</code> function.

    <h3>8.9. Interacting with C's <code>enum</code> Type</h3>

    <p>Although HDF enumeration datatypes are similar to C
      <code>enum</code> datatypes, there are some important
      differences:

	  </tr>

	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top>Symbols are unquoted in C but quoted in
	      HDF.</td>
	    <td valign=top>This allows the application to manipulate
	      symbol names in ways that are not possible with C.</td>
	  </tr>

	  </tr>

	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top>A symbol must appear in only one C
	      <code>enum</code> type but may appear in multiple HDF
	      enumeration types.</td>
	    <td valign=top>The translation from symbol to value in HDF 
	      requires the datatype to be specified while in C the
	      datatype is not necessary because it can be inferred
	      from the symbol.</td>
	  </tr>

	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top>The underlying integer value is always a
	      native integer in C but can be a foreign integer type in 
	      HDF.</td>
	    <td valign=top>This allows HDF to describe data that might 
	      reside on a foreign architecture, such as data stored in 
	      a file.</td>
	  </tr>

	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top>The sign and size of the underlying integer 
	      datatype is chosen automatically by the C compiler but
	      must be fully specified with HDF.</td>
	    <td valign=top>Since HDF doesn't require finalization of a 
	      datatype, complete specification of the type must be
	      supplied before the type is used.  Requiring that
	      information at the time of type creation was a design
	      decision to simplify the library.</td>

    <h4>Creating HDF Types from C Types</h4>

    <p>An HDF enumeration datatype can be created from a C
      <code>enum</code> type simply by passing pointers to the C
      <code>enum</code> values to <code>H5Tenum_insert()</code>.  For
      instance, to create HDF types for the <code>c_en_colors</code>
      type shown above:

    <p>
      <table width="90%" bgcolor="white">
	<tr>
	  <td>
	    <code><pre>

c_en_colors val;
hid_t hdf_en_colors = H5Tcreate(H5T_ENUM, sizeof(c_en_colors));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "RED",   (val=RED,  &amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "GREEN", (val=GREEN,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "BLUE",  (val=BLUE, &amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "WHITE", (val=WHITE,&amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_en_colors, "BLACK", (val=BLACK,&amp;val));</pre></code>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>

    <h4>Name Changes between Applications</h4>

    <p>Occassionally two applicatons wish to exchange data but they
      use different names for the constants they exchange.  For
      instance, an English and a Spanish program may want to
      communicate color names although they use different symbols in
      the C <code>enum</code> definitions. The communication is still
      possible although the applications must agree on common terms
      for the colors. The following example shows the Spanish code to
      read the values assuming that the applications have agreed that
      the color information will be exchanged using Enlish color
      names:

    <p>
      <table width="90%" bgcolor="white">
	<tr>
	  <td>
	    <code><pre>

c_sp_colors val, data[1000];
hid_t hdf_sp_colors = H5Tcreate(H5T_ENUM, sizeof(c_sp_colors));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_sp_colors, "RED",   (val=ROJO,   &amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_sp_colors, "GREEN", (val=VERDE,  &amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_sp_colors, "BLUE",  (val=AZUL,   &amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_sp_colors, "WHITE", (val=BLANCO, &amp;val));
H5Tenum_insert(hdf_sp_colors, "BLACK", (val=NEGRO,  &amp;val));

H5Dread(dataset, hdf_sp_colors, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, data);</pre></code>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>


    <h4>Symbol Ordering across Applications</h4>

    <p>Since symbol ordering is completely determined by the integer values
      assigned to each symbol in the <code>enum</code> definition,
      ordering of <code>enum</code> symbols cannot be preserved across
      files like with HDF enumeration types.  HDF can convert from one
      application's integer values to the other's so a symbol in one
      application's C <code>enum</code> gets mapped to the same symbol
      in the other application's C <code>enum</code>, but the relative
      order of the symbols is not preserved.

    <p>For example, an application may be defined to use the
      definition of <code>c_en_colors</code> defined above where
      <code>WHITE</code> is less than <code>BLACK</code>, but some
      other application might define the colors in some other
      order. If each application defines an HDF enumeration type based 
      on that application's C <code>enum</code> type then HDF will
      modify the integer values as data is communicated from one
      application to the other so that a <code>RED</code> value
      in the first application is also a <code>RED</code> value in the
      other application.

    <p>A case of this reordering of symbol names was also shown in the 
      previous code snippet (as well as a change of language), where
      HDF changed the integer values so 0 (<code>RED</code>) in the
      input file became 4 (<code>ROJO</code>) in the <code>data</code>
      array. In the input file, <code>WHITE</code> was less than
      <code>BLACK</code>; in the application the opposite is true.

    <p>In fact, the ability to change the order of symbols is often
      convenient when the enumeration type is used only to group
      related symbols that don't have any well defined order
      relationship.

    <h4>Internationalization</h4>

    <p>The HDF enumeration type conversion features can also be used
      to provide internationalization of debugging output.  A program
      written with the <code>c_en_colors</code> datatype could define 
      a separate HDF datatype for languages such as English, Spanish, 
      and French and cast the enumerated value to one of these HDF
      types to print the result.

    <h3>8.10. Goals That Have Been Met</h3>

    <p>The main goal of enumeration types is to provide communication
      of enumerated data using symbolic equivalence.  That is, a
      symbol written to a dataset by one application should be read as
      the same symbol by some other application.

    <p>
      <table width="90%">
	<tr>
	  <td valign=top><b>Architecture Independence</b></td>
	  <td valign=top>Two applications shall be able to exchange
	    enumerated data even when the underlying integer values
	    have different storage formats. HDF accomplishes this for
	    enumeration types by building them upon integer types.</td>

	<tr>
	  <td valign=top><b>Preservation of Order Relationship</b></td>
	  <td valign=top>The relative order of symbols shall be

<h2>9. Variable-length Datatypes</h2>

<h3>9.1. Overview And Justification</h3>

Variable-length (VL) datatypes are sequences of an existing datatype
(atomic, VL, or compound) which are not fixed in length from one dataset location
to another.  In essence, they are similar to C character strings -- a sequence of 
a type which is pointed to by a particular type of <em>pointer</em> -- although 
they are implemented more closely to FORTRAN strings by including an explicit 
length in the pointer instead of using a particular value to terminate the 
sequence.

<p>
VL datatypes are useful to the scientific community in many different ways,
some of which are listed below:
<ul>
    <li>Ragged arrays: Multi-dimensional ragged arrays can be implemented with
        the last (fastest changing) dimension being ragged by using a
        VL datatype as the type of the element stored. (Or as a field in a
        compound datatype.)
    <li>Fractal arrays: If a compound datatype has a VL field of another compound
        type with VL fields (a <em>nested</em> VL datatype), this can be used to
        implement ragged arrays of ragged arrays, to whatever nesting depth is
        required for the user.
    <li>Polygon lists: A common storage requirement is to efficiently store arrays
        of polygons with different numbers of vertices.  VL datatypes can be
        used to efficiently and succinctly describe an array of polygons with
        different numbers of vertices.
    <li>Character strings: Perhaps the most common use of VL datatypes will be to
        store C-like VL character strings in dataset elements or as attributes
        of objects.
    <li>Indices: An array of VL object references could be used as an index to
        all the objects in a file which contain a particular sequence of
        dataset values. Perhaps an array something like the following:
        <pre>
            Value1: Object1, Object3,  Object9
            Value2: Object0, Object12, Object14, Object21, Object22
            Value3: Object2
            Value4: &lt;none&gt;
            Value5: Object1, Object10, Object12
                .
                .
        </pre>
    <li>Object Tracking: An array of VL dataset region references can be used as
        a method of tracking objects or features appearing in a sequence of
        datasets.  Perhaps an array of them would look like:
        <pre>
            Feature1: Dataset1:Region,  Dataset3:Region,  Dataset9:Region
            Feature2: Dataset0:Region,  Dataset12:Region, Dataset14:Region,
                      Dataset21:Region, Dataset22:Region
            Feature3: Dataset2:Region
            Feature4: &lt;none&gt;
            Feature5: Dataset1:Region,  Dataset10:Region, Dataset12:Region
                .
                .
        </pre>
</ul>


<h3>9.2. Variable-length Datatype Memory Management</h3>

With each element possibly being of different sequence lengths for a
dataset with a VL datatype, the memory for the VL datatype must be dynamically
allocated.  Currently there are two methods of managing the memory for 
VL datatypes: the standard C malloc/free memory allocation routines or a method
of calling user-defined memory management routines to allocate or free memory.
Since the memory allocated when reading (or writing) may be complicated to
release, an HDF5 routine is provided to traverse a memory buffer and free the
VL datatype information without leaking memory.


<h4>Variable-length datatypes cannot be divided</h4>

VL datatypes are designed so that they cannot be subdivided by the library
with selections, etc.  This design was chosen due to the complexities in
specifying selections on each VL element of a dataset through a selection API
that is easy to understand.  Also, the selection APIs work on dataspaces, not
on datatypes.  At some point in time, we may want to create a way for
dataspaces to have VL components to them and we would need to allow selections
of those VL regions, but that is beyond the scope of this document.


<h4>What happens if the library runs out of memory while reading?</h4>

It is possible for a call to <code>H5Dread</code> to fail while reading in 
VL datatype information if the memory required exceeds that which is available.  
In this case, the <code>H5Dread</code> call will fail gracefully and any 
VL data which has been allocated prior to the memory shortage will be returned 
to the system via the memory management routines detailed below.  
It may be possible to design a <em>partial read</em> API function at a 
later date, if demand for such a function warrants.


<h4>Strings as variable-length datatypes</h4>

Since character strings are a special case of VL data that is implemented
in many different ways on different machines and in different programming 
languages, they are handled somewhat differently from other VL datatypes in HDF5.

<p>
HDF5 has native VL strings for each language API, which are stored the
same way on disk, but are exported through each language API in a natural way
for that language.  When retrieving VL strings from a dataset, users may choose
to have them stored in memory as a native VL string or in HDF5's <code>hvl_t</code> 
struct for VL datatypes.

<p>
VL strings may be created in one of two ways: by creating a VL datatype with
a base type of <code>H5T_NATIVE_ASCII</code>, <code>H5T_NATIVE_UNICODE</code>, 
etc., or by creating a string datatype and setting its length to 
<code>H5T_VARIABLE</code>.  The second method is used to access 
native VL strings in memory.  The library will convert between the two types, 
but they are stored on disk using different datatypes and have different 
memory representations.

<p>
Multi-byte character representations, such as UNICODE or <em>wide</em> 
characters in C/C++, will need the appropriate character and string datatypes 
created so that they can be described properly through the datatype API.  
Additional conversions between these types and the current ASCII characters 
will also be required.

<p>
Variable-width character strings (which might be compressed data or some
other encoding) are not currently handled by this design.  We will evaluate
how to implement them based on user feedback.


<h3>9.3. Variable-length Datatype API</h3>

<h4>Creation</h4>

VL datatypes are created with the <code>H5Tvlen_create()</code> function 
as follows:
<dl>
    <dd><em>type_id</em> = <code>H5Tvlen_create</code>(<em>hid_t</em> <code>base_type_id</code>);
</dl>

<p>
The base datatype will be the datatype that the sequence is composed of,
characters for character strings, vertex coordinates for polygon lists, etc.
The base datatype specified for the VL datatype can be of any HDF5 datatype,
including another VL datatype, a compound datatype, or an atomic datatype.


<h4>Query base datatype of VL datatype</h4>

It may be necessary to know the base datatype of a VL datatype before 
memory is allocated, etc.  The base datatype is queried with the 
<code>H5Tget_super()</code> function, described in the H5T documentation.


<h4>Query minimum memory required for VL information</h4>

It order to predict the memory usage that <code>H5Dread</code> may need 
to allocate to store VL data while reading the data, the 
<code>H5Dget_vlen_size()</code> function is provided:
<dl>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> 
        <code>H5Dget_vlen_buf_size</code>(<em>hid_t</em> <code>dataset_id</code>, 
        <em>hid_t</em> <code>type_id</code>,
        <em>hid_t</em> <code>space_id</code>, 
        <em>hsize_t</em> *<code>size</code>) 
</dl>
        (This function is not implemented in Release 1.2.)

<p>
This routine checks the number of bytes required to store the VL data from
the dataset, using the <code>space_id</code> for the selection in the dataset 
on disk and the <code>type_id</code> for the memory representation of the 
VL data in memory.  The *<code>size</code> value is modified according to 
how many bytes are required to store the VL data in memory.


<h4>Specifying how to manage memory for the VL datatype</h4>

The memory management method is determined by dataset transfer properties
passed into the <code>H5Dread</code> and <code>H5Dwrite</code> functions 
with the dataset transfer property list.  

<p>
Default memory management is set by using <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code> 
for the dataset transfer property list identifier.
If <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code> is used with <code>H5Dread</code>,
the system <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> calls
will be used for allocating and freeing memory.
In such a case,  <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code> should also be passed
as the property list identifier to <code>H5Dvlen_reclaim</code>.

<p>
The rest of this subsection is relevant only to those who choose 
<i>not</i> to use default memory management.

<p>
The user can choose whether to use the 
system <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> calls  or
user-defined, or custom, memory management functions.
If user-defined memory management functions are to be used, 
the memory allocation and free routines must be defined via 
<code>H5Pset_vlen_mem_manager()</code>, as follows:
<dl>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> 
        <code>H5Pset_vlen_mem_manager</code>(<em>hid_t</em> <code>plist_id</code>,
        <em>H5MM_allocate_t</em> <code>alloc</code>, 
        <em>void</em> *<code>alloc_info</code>,
        <em>H5MM_free_t</em> <code>free</code>, 
        <em>void</em> *<code>free_info</code>)
</dl>


<p>
The <code>alloc</code> and <code>free</code> parameters 
identify the memory management routines to be used.
If the user has defined custom memory management routines,
<code>alloc</code> and/or <code>free</code> should be set to make 
those routine calls (i.e., the name of the routine is used as 
the value of the parameter);  
if the user prefers to use the system's <code> malloc</code>
and/or <code>free</code>, the <code>alloc</code> and 
<code>free</code> parameters, respectively, should be set to 
<code> NULL</code>
<p>
The prototypes for the user-defined functions would appear as follows:
<dl>
    <dd><code>typedef</code> <em>void</em> 
        *(*<code>H5MM_allocate_t</code>)(<em>size_t</em> <code>size</code>, 
        <em>void</em> *<code>info</code>) ;
    <dd><code>typedef</code> <em>void</em> 
        (*<code>H5MM_free_t</code>)(<em>void</em> *<code>mem</code>, 
        <em>void</em> *<code>free_info</code>) ;
</dl>

<p>
The <code>alloc_info</code> and <code>free_info</code> parameters can be 
used to pass along any required information to the user's memory management 
routines.

<p>
In summary, if the user has defined custom memory management 
routines, the name(s) of the routines are passed in the 
<code>alloc</code> and <code>free</code> parameters and the 
custom routines' parameters are passed in the 
<code>alloc_info</code> and <code>free_info</code> parameters.
If the user wishes to use the system <code> malloc</code> and 
<code>free</code> functions, the <code>alloc</code> and/or 
<code>free</code> parameters are set to <code> NULL</code> 
and the  <code>alloc_info</code> and <code>free_info</code> 
parameters are ignored.

<h4>Recovering memory from VL buffers read in</h4>

The complex memory buffers created for a VL datatype may be reclaimed with
the <code>H5Dvlen_reclaim()</code> function call, as follows:
<dl>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> 
        <code>H5Dvlen_reclaim</code>(<em>hid_t</em> <code>type_id</code>, 
        <em>hid_t</em> <code>space_id</code>, 
        <em>hid_t</em> <code>plist_id</code>,
        <em>void</em> *<code>buf</code>);
</dl>

<p>
The <code>type_id</code> must be the datatype stored in the buffer, 
<code>space_id</code> describes the selection for the memory buffer 
to free the VL datatypes within, 
<code>plist_id</code> is the dataset transfer property list which 
was used for the I/O transfer to create the buffer, and 
<code>buf</code> is the pointer to the buffer to free the VL memory within.  
The VL structures (<code>hvl_t</code>) in the user's buffer are 
modified to zero out the VL information after it has been freed.

<p>
If nested VL datatypes were used to create the buffer, 
this routine frees them from the bottom up, 
releasing all the memory without creating memory leaks.


<h3>9.4. Code Examples</h3>

The following example creates the following one-dimensional array 
of size 4 of variable-length datatype.
<pre>
          0 10 20 30
            11 21 31
               22 32
                  33
</pre>
Each element of the VL datatype is of H5T_NATIVE_UINT type.
<p>
The array is stored in the dataset and then read back into memory. 
Default memory management routines are used for writing the VL data.
Custom memory management routines are used for reading the VL data and
reclaiming memory space.

<h2>10. Array Datatypes</h2>

The array class of datatypes, <code>H5T_ARRAY</code>, allows the 
construction of true, homogeneous, multi-dimensional arrays.  
Since these are homogeneous arrays, each element of the array will be 
of the same datatype, designated at the time the array is created.

<p>
Arrays can be nested.
Not only is an array datatype used as an element of an HDF5 dataset,
but the elements of an array datatype may be of any datatype, 
including another array datatype.

<p>
Array datatypes cannot be subdivided for I/O; the entire array must 
be transferred from one dataset to another. 

<p>
Within the limitations outlined in the next paragraph, array datatypes 
may be <em>N</em>-dimensional and of any dimension size.  
Unlimited dimensions, however, are not supported. 
Functionality similar to unlimited dimension arrays is available through 
the use of variable-length datatypes.

<p>
The maximum number of dimensions, i.e., the maximum rank, of an array
datatype is specified by the HDF5 library constant <code>H5S_MAX_RANK</code>.
The minimum rank is 1 (one).
All dimension sizes must be greater than 0 (zero). 

<p>
One array dataype may only be converted to another array datatype 
if the number of dimensions and the sizes of the dimensions are equal 
and the datatype of the first array's elements can be converted 
to the datatype of the second array's elements.

<h3>10.1 Array Datatype APIs</h2>

<h3>10.2 Transition Issues in Adapting Existing Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Transition to HDF5 Release 1.4 Only)</h3>

The array datatype class is new with Release 1.4;  
prior releases included an array element for compound datatypes.
<p>
The use of the array datatype class will not interfere with the 
use of existing compound datatypes.  Applications may continue to 
read and write the older field arrays, but they will no longer be 
able to create array fields in newly-defined compound datatypes.
<p>
Existing array fields will be transparently mapped to array datatypes
when they are read in.


<h3>10.3 Code Example</h3>

The following example creates an array datatype and a dataset 
containing elements of the array datatype in an HDF5 file.
It then writes the dataset to the file.

    <h2>11. Sharing Datatypes among Datasets</h2>

    <p>If a file has lots of datasets which have a common datatype,
      then the file could be made smaller by having all the datasets
      share a single datatype.  Instead of storing a copy of the 
      datatype in each dataset object header, a single datatype is stored
      and the object headers point to it.  The space savings is
      probably only significant for datasets with a compound datatype,
      since the atomic datatypes can be described with just a few
      bytes anyway.

    <p>To create a bunch of datasets that share a single datatype
      just create the datasets with a committed (named) datatype.

    <p>
      <center>
	<table border align=center width="100%">
	  <caption align=bottom><h4>Example: Shared Datatypes</h4></caption>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      <p>To create two datasets that share a common datatype
		one just commits the datatype, giving it a name, and
		then uses that datatype to create the datasets.

	      <p><code><pre>
hid_t t1 = ...some transient type...;
H5Tcommit (file, "shared_type", t1);
hid_t dset1 = H5Dcreate (file, "dset1", t1, space, H5P_DEFAULT);

    <a name="Datatypes-DataConversion">
    <h2>12. Data Conversion</h2>
    </a>

    <p>The library is capable of converting data from one type to
      another and does so automatically when reading or writing the
      raw data of a dataset, attribute data, or fill values. The
      application can also change the type of data stored in an array.

    <p>In order to insure that data conversion exceeds disk I/O rates,
      common data conversion paths can be hand-tuned and optimized for
      performance.  The library contains very efficient code for
      conversions between most native datatypes and a few non-native
      datatypes, but if a hand-tuned conversion function is not
      available, then the library falls back to a slower but more
      general conversion function.  The application programmer can
      define additional conversion functions when the libraries
      repertoire is insufficient. In fact, if an application does
      define a conversion function which would be of general interest,
      we request that the function be submitted to the HDF5
      development team for inclusion in the library.

    <p><b>Note:</b> The HDF5 library contains a deliberately limited
      set of conversion routines.  It can convert from one integer
      format to another, from one floating point format to another,
      and from one struct to another.  It can also perform byte
      swapping when the source and destination types are otherwise the
      same.  The library does not contain any functions for converting
      data between integer and floating point formats.  It is
      anticipated that some users will find it necessary to develop
      float to integer or integer to float conversion functions at the
      application level; users are invited to submit those functions
      to be considered for inclusion in future versions of the
      library.

    <p>A conversion path contains a source and destination datatype
      and each path contains a <em>hard</em> conversion function
      and/or a <em>soft</em> conversion function.  The only difference
      between hard and soft functions is the way in which the library
      chooses which function applies: A hard function applies to a
      specific conversion path while a soft function may apply to
      multiple paths.  When both hard and soft functions apply to a
      conversion path, then the hard function is favored and when
      multiple soft functions apply, the one defined last is favored.

    <p>A data conversion function is of type <code>H5T_conv_t</code>,
	which is defined as follows:

<dir><pre><em>typedef</em> herr_t (<em>*H5T_conv_t</em>) (hid_t <em>src_id</em>, 
                              hid_t <em>dst_id</em>, 
                              H5T_cdata_t *<em>cdata</em>,
                              hsize_t <em>nelmts</em>, 
                              size_t <em>buf_stride</em>, 
                              size_t <em>bkg_stride</em>, 
                              void *<em>buffer</em>, 
                              void *<em>bkg_buffer</em>,
                              hid_t <em>dset_xfer_plist</em>);</pre></dir>
      

    <p>The conversion function is called with 
      the source and destination datatypes (<em>src_id</em> and 
          <em>dst_id</em>), 
      the path-constant data struct (<em>cdata</em>), 
      the number of instances of the datatype to convert (<em>nelmts</em>), 
      a conversion buffer (<em>buffer</em>) which initially contains 
          an array of data having the source type and on return will 
          contain an array of data having the destination type, 
      a temporary or background buffer (<em>bkg_buffer</em>, 
          see description of <code>H5T_BKG_YES</code> below),
      conversion and background buffer strides (<em>buf_stride</em> and
          <em>bkg_stride</em>) that indicate what data is to be converted, and
      a dataset transfer properties list (<em>dset_xfer_plist</em>).  

     <p><em>buf_stride</em> and <em>bkg_stride</em> are in bytes and
      are related to the size of the datatype.
      If every data element is to be converted, the parameter's value 
      is equal to the size of the datatype; 
      if every other data element is to be converted, the parameter's value
      is equal to twice the size of the datatype; etc.

     <p><em>dset_xfer_plist</em> may contain properties that are passed
      to the read and write calls.  
      This parameter is currently used only with variable-length data.

     <p><em>bkg_buffer</em> and <em>bkg_stride</em> are used only with 
      compound datatypes.

     <p>The path-constant data struct, <code>H5T_cdata_t</code>, 
      is declared as follows:
        
<dir><pre><em>typedef</em> struct <em>*H5T_cdata_t</em> (H5T_cmd_t <em>command</em>, 
                             H5T_bkg_t <em>need_bkg</em>, 
                             hbool_t *<em>recalc</em>,
                             void *<em>priv</em>)</pre></dir>

    <p>The <code>command</code> field of the <em>cdata</em> argument
      determines what happens within the conversion function.  It's
      values can be:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_CONV_INIT</code>
      <dd>This command is to hard conversion functions when they're
	registered or soft conversion functions when the library is
	determining if a conversion can be used for a particular path.
	The <em>src_type</em> and <em>dst_type</em> are the end-points
	of the path being queried and <em>cdata</em> is all zero.  The
	library should examine the source and destination types and
	return zero if the conversion is possible and negative
	otherwise (hard conversions need not do this since they've
	presumably been registered only on paths they support).  If
	the conversion is possible the library may allocate and
	initialize private data and assign the pointer to the
	<code>priv</code> field of <em>cdata</em> (or private data can
	be initialized later). It should also initialize the
	<code>need_bkg</code> field described below.  The <em>buf</em>
	and <em>background</em> pointers will be null pointers.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_CONV_CONV</code>
      <dd>This command indicates that data points should be converted.
	The conversion function should initialize the
	<code>priv</code> field of <em>cdata</em> if it wasn't
	initialize during the <code>H5T_CONV_INIT</code> command and
	then convert <em>nelmts</em> instances of the
	<em>src_type</em> to the <em>dst_type</em>. The
	<em>buffer</em> serves as both input and output.  The
	<em>background</em> buffer is supplied according to the value
	of the <code>need_bkg</code> field of <em>cdata</em> (the
	values are described below).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_CONV_FREE</code>
      <dd>The conversion function is about to be removed from some
	path and the private data (the
	<code><em>cdata</em>->priv</code> pointer) should be freed and
	set to null.  All other pointer arguments are null, the
	<em>src_type</em> and <em>dst_type</em> are invalid
	(negative), and the <em>nelmts</em> argument is zero.

	<br><br>
      <dt><em>Others...</em>
      <dd>Other commands might be implemented later and conversion
	functions that don't support those commands should return a
	negative value.
    </dl>


    <p>Whether a background buffer is supplied to a conversion
      function, and whether the background buffer is initialized
      depends on the value of <code><em>cdata</em>->need_bkg</code>
      which the conversion function should have initialized during the
      H5T_CONV_INIT command.  It can have one of these values:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>H5T_BKG_NONE</code>
      <dd>No background buffer will be supplied to the conversion
	function. This is the default.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_BKG_TEMP</code>
      <dd>A background buffer will be supplied but it will not be
	initialized. This is useful for those functions requiring some
	extra buffer space as the buffer can probably be allocated
	more efficiently by the library (the application can supply
	the buffer as part of the dataset transfer property list).

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>H5T_BKG_YES</code>
      <dd>An initialized background buffer is passed to the conversion
	function.  The buffer is initialized with the current values
	of the destination for the data which is passed in through the
	<em>buffer</em> argument. It can be used to "fill in between
	the cracks".  For instance, if the destination type is a
	compound datatype and we are initializing only part of the
	compound datatype from the source type then the background
	buffer can be used to initialize the other part of the
	destination.
    </dl>

    <p>The <code>recalc</code> field of <em>cdata</em> is set when the 
      conversion path table changes. It can be used by conversion
      function that cache other conversion paths so they know when
      their cache needs to be recomputed.


    <p>Once a conversion function is written it can be registered and
      unregistered with these functions:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tregister(H5T_pers_t <em>pers</em>, const
	  char *<em>name</em>, hid_t <em>src_type</em>, hid_t
	  <em>dest_type</em>, H5T_conv_t <em>func</em>)</code>
      <dd>Once a conversion function is written, the library must be
	notified so it can be used.  The function can be registered as
	a hard (<code>H5T_PERS_HARD</code>) or soft
	(<code>H5T_PERS_SOFT</code>) conversion depending on the value
	of <em>pers</em>, displacing any previous conversions for all
	applicable paths.  The <em>name</em> is used only for
	debugging but must be supplied.  If <em>pers</em> is
	<code>H5T_PERS_SOFT</code> then only the type classes of the
	<em>src_type</em> and <em>dst_type</em> are used. For
	instance, to register a general soft conversion function that
	can be applied to any integer to integer conversion one could
	say: <code>H5Tregister(H5T_PERS_SOFT, "i2i", H5T_NATIVE_INT,
	H5T_NATIVE_INT, convert_i2i)</code>.  One special conversion
	path called the "no-op" conversion path is always defined by
	the library and used as the conversion function when no data
	transformation is necessary. The application can redefine this 
	path by specifying a new hard conversion function with a
	negative value for both the source and destination datatypes, 
	but the library might not call the function under certain
	circumstances.

	<br><br>
      <dt><code>herr_t H5Tunregister (H5T_pers_t <em>pers</em>, const
	  char *<em>name</em>, hid_t <em>src_type</em>, hid_t
	  <em>dest_type</em>, H5T_conv_t <em>func</em>)</code>
      <dd>Any conversion path or function that matches the critera
	specified by a call to this function is removed from the type
	conversion table. All fields have the same interpretation as
	for <code>H5Tregister()</code> with the added feature that any
	(or all) may be wild cards.  The
	<code>H5T_PERS_DONTCARE</code> constant should be used to
	indicate a wild card for the <em>pers</em> argument. The wild
	card <em>name</em> is the null pointer or empty string, the
	wild card for the <em>src_type</em> and <em>dest_type</em>
	arguments is any negative value, and the wild card for the
	<em>func</em> argument is the null pointer.  The special no-op 
	conversion path is never removed by this function.

	      <p>The convesion function described in the previous
		example applies to more than one conversion path.
		Instead of enumerating all possible paths, we register
		it as a soft function and allow it to decide which
		paths it can handle.

	      <p><code><pre>
H5Tregister(H5T_PERS_SOFT, "cus2be",
            H5T_NATIVE_INT, H5T_NATIVE_INT,
            cray_ushort2be);

	      <p>This causes it to be consulted for any conversion
		from an integer type to another integer type.  The
		first argument is just a short identifier which will
		be printed with the datatype conversion statistics.

    <p><b>NOTE:</b> The idea of a master soft list and being able to
      query conversion functions for their abilities tries to overcome
      problems we saw with AIO.  Namely, that there was a dichotomy
      between generic conversions and specific conversions that made
      it very difficult to write a conversion function that operated
      on, say, integers of any size and order as long as they don't
      have zero padding.  The AIO mechanism required such a function
      to be explicitly registered (like
      <code>H5Tregister_hard()</code>) for each an every possible
      conversion path whether that conversion path was actually used
      or not.</p>

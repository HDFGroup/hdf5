Process for Creating PDF Version of the HDF5 Reference Manual from Source Files
================================================================================

The PDF version of the HDF5 User's Guide is created from scratch at each 
release from the primary version of the documentation which is maintained in
HTML. (Assuming, of course, that we continue to produce PDF versions.)


1.  Using Macromedia Dreamweaver, define a site that contains all the documents
    that will be included/necessary for PDF generation.


2.  Wherever necessary throughout the source code:

      a) Switch between print and electronic versions of some elements by means
         of switching which section is commented out. (For PDF generation make
         sure the Print version of elements is uncommented)
         NOTE: Look for:
                 <!-- FOR USE WITH ELECTRONIC VERSION -->
                 <!-- FOR USE WITH PRINT VERSION ------->
 

3.  Using HTML DOC:

           Output Format: PDF

           Compression (not critical, change at will): Slider right above 'Fast'
           JPEG Quality (not critical, change at will): 60
  
      d) The Page tab:
           Page Size: Letter, 2-Sided
             Top: 0.50in, Left: 1.00in, Right: 0.50in, Bottom: 0.50in
           Header: Blank, Blank, Blank
           Footer: Blank, Blank, 1,2,3,...
           Number Up: 1

      e) The Colors tab:
           Everything Blank
           Link Style: Plain
    
      f) The Fonts tab:
           Base Font Size: 11.0
           Line Spacing: 1.2
           Body Typeface: Times
           Heading Typeface: Helvetica
           Header/Footer Size: 10.0
           Header/Footer Font: Helvetica
           Character Set: iso-8859-1
           Options: Do Not Check 'Embed Fonts'

      g) The PDF tab:
           PDF Version: 1.3
           Page Mode: Document
           Page Layout: Single
           Page Effect: None
           Options: Check 'Include Links'

      h) The Security tab:
           Encryption: No

      i) The Options tab:
           HTML Editor: Point to Dreamweaver (recommended)
           Browser Width: 680
           GUI Option: Check all 3

      j) Save the book file.
     
      k) Verify that the output file (H5_newUG.pdf) is not open.

      l) Generate the document.

4.  Open H5_newUG.pdf
    
      a) Scan through the document page by page to verify that there are no 
         elements that should have been eliminated via javascripts or swapped 
         commentation.

      b) Scan through again looking only for places where page breaks need 
         to be added, removed, or relocated.  I have found that re-generating 
         the document after every pagination correction actually saves time 
         in the long run.  This is because some pagination corrections that 
         must be made may create other problems further down in the document.  
         Re-generating the document ensures that every problem you focus on 
         won't have to be re-done.

      c) When you are sure all the pagination is correct (don't forget to 
         start each of the sections included in the Table of Contents on a 
         recto) note page numbers for the beginning of each section in the TOC.

5.  Open RM_TOC.html

      a) Edit page numbers accordingly. 

      b) Save.

             H5_newUG_TOC.html
           Logo Image: none
           Title File/Image: none

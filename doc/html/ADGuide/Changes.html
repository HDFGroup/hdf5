This document is intended to assist application developers who must keep 
an application synchroniaed with the HDF5 library or related software.


<h2>Release 1.4 (current release)</h2>

<dir>

    Several functions were added to or removed from the HDF5 library
    in the development of Release 1.4.
    A few functions have been modified in minor ways.

    <h3>New Functions</h3>
        The following functions are new for Release 1.4 and are included in the
        <a href="../RM_H5Front.html"><cite>HDF5 Reference Manual</cite></a>.

CONTENTS

- New Features
- h4toh5 Utility 
- F90 Support
- C++ Support
- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.2.0 
- Platforms Tested
- Known Problems

New Features
============
   * The Virtual File Layer, VFL, was added to replace the old file
     drivers. It also provides an API for user defined file drivers.
   * New features added to snapshots. Use 'snapshot help' to see a
     complete list of features.
   * Improved configure to detect if MPIO routines are available when
     parallel mode is requested.
   * Added Thread-Safe support. Phase I implemented.
   * Added data sieve buffering to raw data I/O path. This is enabled
     for all VFL drivers except the mpio & core drivers. Setting the
     sieve buffer size is controlled with the new API function,
     H5Pset_sieve_buf_size(), and retrieved with H5Pget_sieve_buf_size().
   * Added new Virtual File Driver, Stream VFD, to send/receive entire
     HDF5 files via socket connections.
   * As parts of VFL, HDF-GASS and HDF-SRB are also added to this
     release. To find out details, please read INSTALL_VFL file. 
   * Increased maximum number of dimensions for a dataset (H5S_MAX_RANK)
     from 31 to 32 to align with HDF4 & netCDF.
   * Added 'query' function to VFL drivers.  Also added 'type' parameter to
     VFL 'read' & 'write' calls, so they are aware of the type of data
     being accessed in the file.  Updated the VFL document also.
   * A new h4toh5 uitlity, to convert HDF4 files to analogous HDF5 files.
   * Added a new array datatype to the datatypes which can be created.  Removed
     "array fields" from compound datatypes (use an array datatype instead).
   * Parallel HDF5 works correctly with mpich-1.2.1 on Solaris, SGI, Linux.

h4toh5 Utility 
==============

    The h4toh5 utility is a new utility that converts an HDF4 file to an 
    HDF5 file.  For details, see the document, "Mapping HDF4 Objects to 
    HDF5 Objects":
       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/papers/H4-H5MappingGuidelines.pdf

    Known Limitations of the h4toh5 beta release
    ---------------------------------------------

    1. Error Handling

    Error reporting is minimal.

    2. String Datatype

    HDF4 has no 'string' type. String valued data are usually defined as
    an array of 'char' in HDF4. The h4toh5 utility will generally map
    these to HDF5 'String' types rather than array of char, with the
    following additional rules:

       * For the data of an HDF4 SDS, image, and palette, if the data is
	 declared 'DFNT_CHAR8' it will be assumed to be integer and
	 will be an H5T_INTEGER type.
       * For attributes of any HDF4 object, data of type 'DFNT_CHAR8'
	 will be converted to an HDF5 'H5T_STRING' type.
       * For an HDF4 Vdata, it is difficult to determine whether data 
	 of type 'DFNT_CHAR8' is intended to be bytes or characters.
	 The h4toh5 utility will consider them to be C characters, and
	 will convert them to an HDF5 'H5T_STRING' type.


    3. Compression, Chunking and External Storage

    Chunking is supported, but compression and external storage is not.

    An HDF4 object that uses chunking will be converted to an HDF5 file
    with analogous chunked storage.

    An HDF4 object that uses compression will be converted to an
    uncompressed HDF5 object.  

    An HDF4 object that uses external storage will be converted to an
    HDF5 object without external storage.  

    4. Memory Use

    The beta version of the h4toh5 utility copies data from HDF4 objects
    in a single read followed by a single write to the HDF5 object. For
    large objects, this requires a very large amount of memory, which may
    be extremely slow or fail on some platforms.

    Note that a dataset that has only been partly written will
    be read completely, including uninitialized data, and all the
    data will be written to the HDF5 object.

    5. Platforms

    The h4toh5 utility requires HDF5.1.4.

    The beta h4toh5 utility has been tested on Solaris 2.6, Solaris 2.5,
    Irix 6.5, HPUX 11.0, DEC Unix, FreeBSD, and Windows 2000.

F90 Support
===========
 
    This is the first release of the HDF5 Library with fully integrated 
    F90 API support.  The Fortran Library is created when the 
    --enable-fortran flag is specified during configuration.

    Not all F90 subroutines are implemented. Please refer to the HDF5 
    Reference Manual for more details.
   
    F90 APIs are available for the Solaris 2.6 and 2.7, Linux, DEC UNIX, 
    T3E, J90 and O2K (64 bit option only) platforms. The Parallel version of 
    the HDF5 F90 Library is supported on the O2K and T3E platforms.

    Changes since the last prototype release (July 2000)
    ----------------------------------------------------

       * h5open_f and h5close_f must be called instead of h5init_types and 
         h5close_types.

       * The following subroutines are no longer available: 
             h5pset_xfer_f
             h5pget_xfer_f
             h5pset_mpi_f
             h5pget_mpi_f
             h5pset_stdio_f
             h5pget_stdio_f
             h5pset_sec2_f
             h5pget_sec2_f
             h5pset_core_f
             h5pget_core_f
             h5pset_family_f
             h5pget_family_f
             
       * The following functions have been added:
             h5pset_fapl_mpio_f
             h5pget_fapl_mpio_f
             h5pset_dxpl_mpio_f
             h5pget_dxpl_mpio_f
        
       * In the previous HDF5 F90 releases, the implementation of object 
         references and dataset region references was not portable. This 
         release introduces a portable implementation, but it also introduces 
         changes to the read/write APIs that handle references.  If object or 
         dataset region references are written or read to/from an HDF5 file, 
         h5dwrite_f and h5dread_f must use the extra parameter, n, for the 
         buffer size:

            h5dwrite(read)_f(dset_id, mem_type_id, buf, n, hdferr, &
                                                       ^^^ 
                             mem_space_id, file_space_id, xfer_prp)

         For other datatypes the APIs were not changed. 
              
             
C++ Support
===========

        This is the first release of the HDF5 Library with fully integrated 
        C++ API support. The HDF5 C++ library is built when the --enable-cxx
        flag is specified during configuration.

        Check the HDF5 Reference Manual for available C++ documentation.

        C++ APIs are available for Solaris 2.6 and 2.7, Linux, and FreeBSD. 
 

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.2.0
==========================

Library
-------

   * The function H5Pset_mpi is renamed as H5Pset_fapl_mpio.
   * Corrected a floating point number conversion error for the Cray J90
     platform. The error did not convert the value 0.0 correctly.
   * Error was fixed which was not allowing dataset region references to
     have their regions retrieved correctly.
   * Corrected a bug that caused non-parallel file drivers to fail in
     the parallel version.
   * Added internal free-lists to reduce memory required by the library
     and H5garbage_collect API function
   * Fixed error in H5Giterate which was not updating the "index"
     parameter correctly.
   * Fixed error in hyperslab iteration which was not walking through the
     correct sequence of array elements if hyperslabs were staggered in a
     certain pattern
   * Fixed several other problems in hyperslab iteration code.
   * Fixed another H5Giterate bug which was causes groups with large
     numbers of objects in them to misbehave when the callback function
     returned non-zero values.
   * Changed return type of H5Aiterate and H5A_operator_t typedef to be
     herr_t, to align them with the dataset and group iterator functions.
   * Changed H5Screate_simple and H5Sset_extent_simple to not allow
     dimensions of size 0 with out the same dimension being unlimited.
   * QAK - 4/19/00 - Improved metadata hashing & caching algorithms to
     avoid many hash flushes and also remove some redundant I/O when
     moving metadata blocks in the file.
   * The "struct(opt)" type conversion function which gets invoked for
     certain compound datatype conversions was fixed for nested compound
     types. This required a small change in the datatype conversion
     function API.
   * Re-wrote lots of the hyperslab code to speed it up quite a bit.
   * Added bounded garbage collection for the free lists when they run
     out of memory and also added H5set_free_list_limits API call to
     allow users to put an upper limit on the amount of memory used for
     free lists.
   * Checked for non-existent or deleted objects when dereferencing one
     with object or region references and disallow dereference.
   * "Time" datatypes (H5T_UNIX_D*) were not being stored and retrieved
     from object headers correctly, fixed now.
   * Fixed H5Dread or H5Dwrite calls with H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE requests
     that may hang because not all processes are transfer the same amount
     of data. (A.K.A. prematured collective return when zero amount data
     requested.) Collective calls that may cause hanging is done via the
     corresponding MPI-IO independent calls.

Configuration
-------------

   * The hdf5.h include file was fixed to allow the HDF5 Library to be
     compiled with other libraries/applications that use GNU autoconf. 
   * Configuration for parallel HDF5 was improved. Configure now attempts
     to link with libmpi.a and/or libmpio.a as the MPI libraries by
     default. It also uses "mpirun" to launch MPI tests by default. It
     tests to link MPIO routines during the configuration stage, rather
     than failing later as before. One can just do "./configure
     --enable-parallel" if the MPI library is in the system library.
   * Added support for pthread library and thread-safe option.
   * The libhdf5.settings file shows the correct machine byte-sex.
   * Added option "--enable-stream-vfd" to configure w/o the Stream VFD.
     For Solaris, added -lsocket to the LIBS list of libraries.

Tools
-----
    * h5dump now accepts both short and long command-line parameters. A
      change from the old way is that multiple attributes, datasets,
      groups, soft-links, and object-ids cannot be specified with just
      one flag but you have to use a flag with each object. I.e., instead
      of doing this:

        h5dump -a /attr1 /attr2 foo.h5

      do this:

        h5dump -a /attr1 -a /attr2 foo.h5

      The cases are similar for the other object types.
    * h5dump correctly displays compound datatypes.
    * Corrected an error in h5toh4 which did not convert the 32bits
      int from HDF5 to HDF4 corectly for the T3E platform.
    * h5dump correctly displays the committed copy of predefined types
      correctly.
    * Added an option, -V, to show the version information of h5dump.
    * Fixed a core dumping bug of h5toh4 when executed on platforms like 
      TFLOPS.
    * The test script for h5toh4 used to not able to detect the hdp
      dumper command was not valid.  It now detects and reports the
      failure of hdp execution.
    * Merged the tools with the 1.2.2 branch. Required adding new
      macros, VERSION12 and VERSION13, used in conditional compilation.
      Updated the Windows project files for the tools.            
    * h5dump displays opaque and bitfield data correctly.
    * h5dump and h5ls can browse files created with the Stream VFD
      (eg. "h5ls <hostname>:<port>").
    * h5dump has a new feature "-o <filename>" which outputs the raw data
      of the dataset into ascii text file <filename>.
    * h5toh4 used to converts hdf5 strings type to hdf4 DFNT_INT8 type.
      Corrected to produce hdf4 DFNT_CHAR type instead.
    * h5dump and h5ls displays array data correctly.

Documentation
-------------

    * User's Guide and Reference Manual were updated. 
      See doc/html/PSandPDF/index.html for more details. 

   
Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.0-beta2
================================

    * Corrected configuration error which was not including compression support
        correctly.
    * Cleaned up lots of warnings.
    * Changed a few h5dump command line switches and added long versions of
        the switches.

Platforms Tested

Known Problems
==============

* When building the HDF5 test project on Windows NT 4.0 (testhdf5
  and testhdf5dll), the compiler fails to compile tvstr.c within
  the whole project; however, when separately selecting the 
  tvstr.c source code, it passes the compiler and everything that
  depends on tvstr.obj links correctly.

* h4toh5 fails on object references on the Cray T3E.

* The installation of the DEC Fortran binaries fails.  It can be
  done manually by copying the *.mod files from the fortran/src
  directory.

* Fortran modules are not installed when created. This should be done
  manually by copying the modules from the fortran/src directory.

* SunOS 5.6 with C WorkShop Compilers 4.2:  Hyperslab selections will 
  fail if library is compiled using optimization of any level.

* The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows.
  It is not supported in the TFLOPS machine.

* Shared library option is broken for IBM SP and some Origin 2000 platforms.
  One needs to run ./configure with '--disable-shared'

* The ./dsets tests failed in the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The hdf5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
    - Solaris x86 2.5.1, Cray T3E and Cray J90 give errors during testing
        when displaying object references in certain files.  These are benign 
        differences due to the difference in sizes of the objects created on
        those platforms.  h5ls appears to be dumping object references
        correctly.
    - Cray J90 (and Cray T3E?) give errors during testing when displaying
        some floating-point values.  These are benign differences due to the
        different precision in the values displayed and h5ls appears to be
        dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

I. Release Information for hdf5-1.2.1

Bug fixes since HDF5-1.2.0
==========================

Configuration
-------------

   * The hdf5.h include file was fixed to allow the HDF5 Library to be compiled
     with other libraries/applications that use GNU autoconf. 
   * Configuration for parallel HDF5 was improved. Configure now attempts to
     link with libmpi.a and/or libmpio.a as the MPI libraries by default.
     It also uses "mpirun" to launch MPI tests by default.  It tests to
     link MPIO routines during the configuration stage, rather than failing
     later as before.  One can just do "./configure --enable-parallel"
     if the MPI library is in the system library.

Library
-------

   * Error was fixed which was not allowing dataset region references to have
     their regions retrieved correctly.
   * Added internal free-lists to reduce memory required by the library and
     H5garbage_collect API function
   * Fixed error in H5Giterate which was not updating the "index" parameter
     correctly.
   * Fixed error in hyperslab iteration which was not walking through the
     correct sequence of array elements if hyperslabs were staggered in a
     certain pattern
   * Fixed several other problems in hyperslab iteration code.

Tests
------
   * Added additional tests for group and attribute iteration.
   * Added additional test for staggered hyperslab iteration.
   * Added additional test for random 5-D hyperslab selection.

Tools
------

   * Added an option, -V, to show the version information of h5dump.
   * Fixed a core dumping bug of h5toh4 when executed on platforms like 
     TFLOPS.
   * The test script for h5toh4 used to not able to detect the hdp
     dumper command was not valid.  It now detects and reports the
     failure of hdp execution.

Documentation
-------------

   * User's Guide and Reference Manual were updated.

   --------------

* NT alpha 4.0
  Dumper utiliy h5dump fails if linked with DLL.

* SunOS 5.6 with C WorkShop Compilers 4.2
  Hyperslab selections will fail if library is compiled using optimization
  of any level.

 
C. Changes Since Version 1.0.1
   ---------------------------

1. Documentation
   -------------

* More examples

* Updated user guide, reference manual, and format specification.

* Self-contained documentation for installations isolated from the
  Internet.

* HDF5 Tutorial was added to the documentation  

2. Configuration
   -------------

* Better detection and support for MPI-IO.

* Recognition of compilers with known code generation problems.

* Support for various compilers on a single architecture (e.g., the
  native compiler and the GNU compilers).

* Ability to build from read-only media and with different compilers
  and/or options concurrently.

* Added a libhdf5.settings file which summarizes the configuration
  information and is installed along with the library.

* Builds a shared library on most systems that support it.

* Support for Cray T3E, J90 and Windows/NT.

3. Debugging
   ---------

* Improved control and redirection of debugging and tracing messages.

4. Datatypes
   ---------

* Optimizations to compound datatype conversions and I/O operations.

* Added nearly 100 optimized conversion functions for native datatypes 
  including support for non-aligned data.

* Added support for bitfield, opaque, and enumeration types.

* Added distinctions between signed and unsigned char types to the
  list of predefined native hdf5 datatypes.

* Added HDF5 type definitions for C9x types like int32_t.

* Application-defined type conversion functions can handle non-packed
  data.

* Changed the H5Tunregister() function to use wildcards when matching
  conversion functions.  H5Tregister_hard() and H5Tregister_soft()
  were combined into H5Tregister().

* Support for variable-length datatypes (arrays of varying length per
  dataset element). Variable length strings currently supported only
  as variable length arrays of 1-byte integers.

5. Dataspaces
   ----------

* New query functions for selections.

* I/O operations bypass the stripmining loop and go directly to
  storage for certain contiguous selections in the absense of type
  conversions.  In other cases the stripmining buffers are used more
  effectively.

* Reduced the number of I/O requests under certain circumstances,
  improving performance on systems with high I/O latency.

6. Persistent Pointers
   -------------------

* Object (serial and parallel) and dataset region (serial only)
  references are implemented.

7. Parallel Support
   ----------------

* Improved parallel I/O performance.

* Supported new platforms: Cray T3E, Linux, DEC Cluster.

* Use vendor supported version of MPIO on SGI O2K and Cray platforms.

* Improved the algorithm that translates an HDF5 hyperslab selection
  into an MPI type for better collective I/O performance.

     Extendable dimension datasets must use chunked storage methods.
     A new function, H5Dextend, is created to extend the current
     dimensions of a dataset.  The current release requires the
     MPI application must make a collective call to extend the
     dimensions of an extendable dataset before writing to the
     newly extended area.  (The serial does not require the
     call of H5Dextend.  The dimensions of an extendable
     dataset is increased when data is written to beyond the
     current dimensions but within the maximum dimensions.)
     The required collective call of H5Dextend may be relaxed
     in future release.

     This release only support independent read and write accesses
     to extendable datasets.  Collective accesses to extendable
     datasets will be implemented in future releases.

   o Collective access to fixed dimension datasets.
     Collective access to a dataset can be specified in the transfer
     property list argument in H5Dread and H5Dwrite.  The current
     release supports collective access to fixed dimension datasets.
     Collective access to extendable datasets will be implemented in
     future releases.

   o HDF5 files are opened according to Communicator and INFO object.
     H5Dopen now records the communicator and INFO setup by H5Pset_mmpi
     and pass them to the corresponding MPIO open file calls for
     processing.

   o This release has been tested on IBM SP2, Intel Red and SGI Origin 2000
     systems.  It uses the ROMIO version of MPIO interface for parallel
     I/O supports.



IV. Changes Since The Beta 1.0.0 Release

* Added fill values for datasets.  For contiguous datasets fill value
  performance may be quite poor since the fill value is written to the 
  entire dataset when the dataset is created.  This will be remedied
  in a future version.  Chunked datasets using fill values do not
  incur any additional overhead. See H5Pset_fill_value().

* Multiple hdf5 files can be "mounted" on one another to create a
  larger virtual file. See H5Fmount().

* Object names can be removed or changed but objects are never
  actually removed from the file yet. See H5Gunlink() and H5Gmove().

* Added a tuning mechanism for B-trees to insure that sequential
  writes to chunked datasets use less overhead.  See H5Pset_btree_ratios().

* Various optimizations and bug fixes.


V. Changes Since The Second Alpha 1.0.0 Release

* Strided hyperslab selections in dataspaces now working.

* The compression API has been replaced with a more general filter
  API.  See doc/html/Filters.html for details.

* Alpha-quality 2d ragged arrays are implemented as a layer built on
  top of other hdf5 objects.  The API and storage format will almost
  certainly change.

* More debugging support including API tracing.  See Debugging.html.

* C and Fortran style 8-bit fixed-length character string types are
  supported with space or null padding or null termination and
  translations between them.

* Added function H5Fflush() to write all cached data immediately to
  the file.

* Datasets maintain a modification time which can be retrieved with
  H5Gstat().

* The h5ls tool can display much more information, including all the
  values of a dataset.


VI. Changes Since The First Alpha 1.0.0 Release

* Two of the packages have been renamed.  The data space API has been
  renamed from `H5P' to `H5S' and the property list (template) API has 
  been renamed from `H5C' to `H5P'.

* The new attribute API `H5A' has been added.  An attribute is a small 
  dataset which can be attached to some other object (for instance, a
  4x4 transformation matrix attached to a 3-dimensional dataset, or an 
  English abstract attached to a group).

* The error handling API `H5E' has been completed.  By default, when an
  API function returns failure an error stack is displayed on the
  standard error stream.  The H5Eset_auto() controls the automatic
  printing and H5E_BEGIN_TRY/H5E_END_TRY macros can temporarily
  disable the automatic error printing.

* Support for large files and datasets (>2GB) has been added.  There
  is an html document that describes how it works.  Some of the types
  for function arguments have changed to support this: all arguments
  pertaining to sizes of memory objects are `size_t' and all arguments 
  pertaining to file sizes are `hsize_t'.

* More data type conversions have been added although none of them are
  fine tuned for performance.  There are new converters from integer
  to integer and float to float, but not between integers and floating
  points.  A bug has been fixed in the converter between compound
  types.

* The numbered types have been removed from the API: int8, uint8,
  int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, float32, and float64.
  Use standard C types instead.  Similarly, the numbered types were
  removed from the H5T_NATIVE_* architecture; use unnumbered types
  which correspond to the standard C types like H5T_NATIVE_INT.

* More debugging support was added.  If tracing is enabled at
  configuration time (the default) and the HDF5_TRACE environment
  variable is set to a file descriptor then all API calls will emit
  the function name, argument names and values, and return value on
  that file number.  There is an html document that describes this.
  If appropriate debugging options are enabled at configuration time,
  some packages will display performance information on stderr.

* Data types can be stored in the file as independent objects and
  multiple datasets can share a data type.

* The raw data I/O stream has been implemented and the application can 
  control meta and raw data caches, so I/O performance should be
  improved from the first alpha release.

* Group and attribute query functions have been implemented so it is
  now possible to find out the contents of a file with no prior
  knowledge.

* External raw data storage allows datasets to be written by other
  applications or I/O libraries and described and accessed through
  HDF5.

* Hard and soft (symbolic) links are implemented which allow groups to 
  share objects. Dangling and recursive symbolic links are supported.

* User-defined data compression is implemented although we may
  generalize the interface to allow arbitrary user-defined filters
  which can be used for compression, checksums, encryption,
  performance monitoring, etc.  The publicly-available `deflate'
  method is predefined if the GNU libz.a can be found at configuration 
  time.

* The configuration scripts have been modified to make it easier to
  build debugging vs. production versions of the library.

* The library automatically checks that the application was compiled
  with the correct version of header files.


		    Parallel HDF5 Changes

* Parallel support for fixed dimension datasets with contiguous or
  chunked storages.  Also, support unlimited dimension datasets which
  must use chunk storage.  No parallel support for compressed datasets.

* Collective data transfer for H5Dread/H5Dwrite.  Collective access
  support for datasets with contiguous storage only, thus only fixed
  dimension datasets for now.

* H5Pset_mpi and H5Pget_mpi no longer have the access_mode
  argument.  It is taken over by the data-transfer property list
  of H5Dread/H5Dwrite.

* New functions H5Pset_xfer and H5Pget_xfer to handle the
  specification of independent or collective data transfer_mode
  in the dataset transfer properties list.  The properties
  list can be used to specify data transfer mode in the H5Dwrite
  and H5Dread function calls.

* Added parallel support for datasets with chunked storage layout.
  When a dataset is extend in a PHDF5 file, all processes that open
  the file must collectively call H5Dextend with identical new dimension
  sizes.

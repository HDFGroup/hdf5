- Documentation
- Platforms Tested
- Supported Configuration Features Summary
- Known Problems


New Features
============
    Configuration:
    -------------------------
    - Added a Make target of check-all-install to test the correctness of
      installing via the prefix= or $DESTDIR options. AKC - 2009/04/14

    Library:
    --------
    - None

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
    - Modified parallel tests to run with arbitrary number of processes. The
      modified tests are testphdf5 (parallel dataset access, collective chunk
      IO, irregular hyperslab selection with collective IO) and
      t_chunk_alloc (chunk allocation). The rest of the parallel tests already
      use in the code the number of processes available in the communicator.
      CMC - 2009/04/28

    Tools:
    ------
    - h5diff new flag, -c, --compare, list objects that are not comparable.
      PVN - 2009/4/10 - 1368
    - h5diff new flag, -N, --nan, avoids NaNs detection. PVN - 2009/4/10
    - h5dump correctly specifies XML dtd / schema urls ADB - 2009/4/3 - 1519
    - h5dump: binary output defaults to NATIVE with -b optionally accepting
      the form of binary output (NATIVE, FILE, BE, LE). PVN - 2008/11/14
    - h5repack: When user doesn't specify a chunk size, h5repack now defines 
      a default chunk size as the same size of the size of the hyperslab 
      used to read the chunks. The size of the hyperslabs are defined as 
      the size of each dimension or a predefined constant, whatever is smaller.
      This assures that the chunk read fits in the chunk cache. PVN - 2008/11/21

    F90 API:
    --------
    - None

    C++ API:
    --------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages and Compilers
==================================================


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.8 Release
==================================
    Library
    -------
    - Added H5Z_class1_t macro, as H5Z_class_t is now versioned in 1.8.
      NAF - 2009/04/20 - 1533
    - Fixed a bug that prevented more than one dataset chunk from being cached
      at a time. NAF - 2009/02/12
    - H5Dset_extent: when shrinking dimensions, some chunks were not deleted. 
      Shrinking to a zero size dimension caused an assertion in the library.  
      PVN - 2009/01/8

    Configuration
    -------------
    - h5perf will now get installed during 'make install'.  MAM - 2008/11/17

    Performance
    -----------

    Tools
    -----
    - h5dump, h5diff, h5repack were not reading (by hyperslabs) datasets 
      that have a datatype datum size greater than H5TOOLS_BUFSIZE, a constant 
      defined as 1024Kb, such as array types with large dimensions. 
      PVN - 2009/4/1 - 1501
    - h5import: By selecting a compression type, a big endian byte order was 
      being selected. PVN - 2009/3/11 - 1462
    - zip_perf.c had missing argument on one of the open() calls. Fixed.
      AKC - 2008/12/9

    F90 API
    -------
    - None
                                
    C++ API
    -------
    - Revised Attribute::write and Attribute::read wrappers to handle
      memory allocation/deallocation properly. (Bugzilla 1045)
      BMR - 2009/4/19


Documentation
=============
    HDF5 documentation can be found in the distributed release source 
    code in the subdirectory doc/html/ (start with index.html) or on the 
    THG (The HDF Group) FTP server: 

         ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/docs/

    Online documentation for the current release in the HDF5 Release 1.6.x 
    series can be found on the THG web site:

         http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc1.6/

    A listing of interface changes from release to release can be found
    in the document "HDF5 Software Changes from Release to Release":

         http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc1.6/ADGuide/Changes.html

    Since the stream I/O driver is not included in this release, the 
    functions H5Pset_fapl_stream and H5Pget_fapl_stream and the stream 
    ENUM value H5FD_STREAM have been removed from the documentation.

Known Problems
==============
* Parallel tests failed with 15, 16, and 32 processes with data inconsistency
  at testphdf5 / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 64 processes
  with collective abort of all ranks at testphdf5  / collective irregular simple
  chunk write. CMC - 2009/04/28

* h5repack may not handle committed datatypes correctly. NAF - 2009/4/20 - 1516/
  1466

* When in production mode, any presence of the '-g' flag within CFLAGS is
  stripped out during configuration. This currently cannot be overridden. 
  In order to build with '-g' specified within CFLAGS, use the
  --disable-production configure flag in order to configure in development
  mode. MAM - 2009/03/09.

* We discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 tests
  with chunking storage with the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a Linux
  cluster at NCSA.
  Under some complex selection cases, 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  This only happens when turning on collective IO with chunking storage
  with some complex selections. We haven't found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use Independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this problem, change the following line in your code:
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);
  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);
  KY - 2007/08/24

* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) does not create h5pfc correctly. It
  does not include the -lmpi properly.  This will be fixed in the next
  release.  AKC - 2007/08/07.

* On IRIX64 6.5 (UCAR SGI mop1), when testing HDF5 tools with an HDF5 shared
  library, especially for h5repacktst and h52gifgentst, the following (or a
  similar) error message may appear:
  "523648:lt-h5repacktst: rld: Fatal Error: Cannot Successfully map soname
  'libh5test.so.1' under any of the filenames .......(bunch of directories)
  "
  And the testing will fail. 

  We believe this is a libtool problem. One way to get rid of this is to
  add the paths of libh5test.so.1 and libh5.so.1 to the shared library path.

  You may do this, under csh:
  setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH [full path of HDF5 directory/test/.libs]:[full 
  path of HDF5 directory/src/.libs]:(existing paths)...

  NOTE: This problem ONLY affects the testing of the HDF5 library when you 
  build from source. It won't affect any applications that would like to link 
  with the HDF5 shared library since the shared library path needs to be set 
  anyway.  KY - 2007/8/2

* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) failed the testpar/testphdf5 sub-test
  "calloc".  All other tests passed.  This indicates that a dataset using 
  chunked storage created by serial HDF5 may not work properly with parallel 
  HDF5.  The calloc test can be skipped by running "prun ... testphdf5 -x 
  calloc".  AKC - 2007/7/12.

* When testing parallel HDF5 with the C compiler version MIPSpro 7.4.3 on IRIX
  6.5, set the environment variable MPI_TYPE_MAX to be a bigger number, for 
  example 120000, in order to pass the complicated collective IO tests inside 
  the parallel HDF5 library. This is not a problem inside the parallel HDF5 
  library. You can always set a bigger number on your system.  KY - 2005/10/6

* A contiguous or chunked dataset created by a sequential version of HDF5 
  might not be able to be modified with a parallel version of the library. 
  Use the H5Pset_alloc_time function with H5D_ALLOC_TIME_EARLY to set up the 
  dataset creation property list to avoid the problem.  EIP - 2005/09/09

* A dataset created or rewritten with the v1.6.3 library or after can't 
  be read with the v1.6.2 library or before when Fletcher32 EDC (a filter) is 
  enabled.  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 
  checksum in the library before v1.6.3.  The checksum value wasn't consistent 
  between big-endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in 
  Release 1.6.3.  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value is no 
  longer the same as before on little-endian system.  HDF5 library releases 
  after 1.6.4 can still read datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 
  library of v1.6.2 or before.  SLU - 2005/7/8

* test/big fails sometimes with the message "Possible overlap with another
  region."  The test selects regions randomly, and this error occurs when
  two regions overlap each other; it is a bug in the test and not in
  HDF5.  Since the error is triggered by a random situation, it will
  usually disappear if the test is re-run.

* Newer SGI MIPSpro compilers (version 7.4.x) support C99 features but 
  have a "guard" statement in stdint.h that will #error and skip the rest
  of the header file if the C99 option is not used explicitly.  Hardsetting
  $CC to c99 will resolve the problem. AKC - 2004/12/13

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command poe.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may also fail with messages like "The socket name is already
  in use".  HDF5 does not use sockets.  This is due to problems of the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  Check whether there are 
  many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  These are sockets used by 
  the poe command and left behind due to failed commands.  Ask your system 
  administrator to clean them out.  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means 
  to run poe without the debug socket.

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the HPUX 11.00.

  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* Use the --disable-shared configure flag if building with an Absoft Fortran
  compiler.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8.

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the following test:
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 
  10**-308.  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 
  0.0, but occasionally appear as 10**-308.  This has been reported to the 
  system staff.

  All other tests have passed.

- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.7
- Documentation
- Platforms Tested
- Supported Configuration Features Summary
- Known Problems


New Features
============
    Configuration:
    -------------------------
	- Added no-repeat test feature from v1.8 to this branch.  What it does
	  is that if a test has passed in previous "make check", it will not
	  run again unless its executable has changed. This can be overridden
	  by "make check-clean" which removes all check-success markers and
	  let all tests run again. AKC - 2008/2/22.

    Library:
    --------
     - Added support for $(DESTDIR) to the install feature. AKC - 2008/10/13.
     - Added version compatibility macros for functions changed in 1.8.  For
           example, H5Gcreate1 will work the same in both 1.6 and 1.8.
           NAF - 2008/10/11

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
    None      

    Tools:
    ------
     - h5repack and h5diff changed command line parameter syntax to be
           similar to h5dump, adding also long switch names. PVN - 2008/2/13
     - h5repack now supports adding multiple filters to all objects. 
	     PVN - 2008/2/13
     - h5import imports string (text) data.  PVN - 2008/2/19
     - h5dump: add a printing of the compression ratio of uncompressed and 
       compressed sizes for cases where compression  filters are present. 
             PVN - 2008/05/01
     - h5dump: added an option to allow a user defined formatting string for 
       printf regarding floating point numbers.  PVN - 2008/05/06
     - h5repack: add a userblock to an HDF5 file during the repack. 
             PVN - 2008/08/26
     - h5repack: copy userblock from HDF5 file during the repack. 
             PVN - 2008/08/26
     - h5diff: return 1 for file differences when both file graphs differ by 
       any object. Error return code was changed to 2 from -1. 
             PVN - 2008/10/30
     - h5import: TEXTFPE (scientific format) was deprecated. Use TEXTFP 
       instead.  PVN - 2008/10/30
    

    

    F90 API:
    --------
    None

    C++ API:
    --------
        - These member functions were added as wrapper for H5Rdereference to
          replace the incorrect IdComponent::dereference().
             void H5Object::dereference(H5Object& obj, void* ref, 
                                        H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             void H5Object::dereference(H5File& h5file, void* ref, 
                                        H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             void H5Object::dereference(Attribute& obj, void* ref, 
                                        H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)

          In addition, these constructors were added to create the associated
          objects by way of dereference:
            DataSet(H5Object& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
            DataSet(H5File& file, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
            DataSet(Attribute& attr, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
            Group(H5Object& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
            Group(H5File& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
            Group(Attribute& attr, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
            DataType(H5Object& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
            DataType(H5File& file, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
            DataType(Attribute& attr, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
          BMR - 2008/10/29


Support for New Platforms, Languages and Compilers
==================================================
    None

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.7 Release
==================================

    Library
    -------
     - Changed the return value of H5Fget_obj_count from INT to SSIZE_T. Also
       changed the return value of H5Fget_obj_ids from HERR_T to SSIZE_T and
       the type of the parameter MAX_OBJS from INT to SIZE_T. 
       SLU - 2008/09/26

    Configuration
    -------------
     - Fixed error with 'make check install' failing due to h5dump
       needing other tools built first. MAM - 2008/10/22.
     - Fixed error with exampples/ph5example getting built even in serial
       mode. Will now only get built and tested if parallel is enabled.
       MAM - 2008/09/18
     - The file libhdf5_fortran.settings is not installed since its content
       is included in libhdf5.settings now. AKC - 2008/10/21
     - The GASS and SRB virtual file drivers have been retired and removed
       from the HDF5 library. AKC - 2008/9/26


    Performance
    -------------
     None
   

    Tools
    -----
     - h5import bug on Windows w/binary datasets. fread in windows needs a 
       binary file to be open with 'rb' instead of 'r' otherwise it terminates 
       execution if an end of file character is found on the input file. 
       Besides that the binary file generated needs to be open with 'wb', 
       otherwise an end of line character is read twice. PVN - 2008/2/19
     - Fixed h5diff regarding the display of NaN (Not a Number) values. 
       PVN - 2008/03/04
     - Fixed h5dump regarding the display of array indices and block 
       selections in subsetting. PVN - 2008/03/10 
     - Fixed bug in h5dump that caused binary output to be made only for 
       the first dataset, when several datasets were requested. 
       PVN - 2008/04/07
     - h5dump: when doing binary output (-b), the stdout printing of attributes 
       was done incorrectly. Removed printing of attributes when doing binary 
       output. PVN - 2008/06/05

    Documentation 
    ------------- 
     None


    F90 API
    -------
     None

                                
    C++ API
    -------
        - Fixed a design bug which allowed an Attribute object to create/modify
          attributes (bugzilla #1068).  The API class hierarchy was revised
          to address the problem.  Classes AbstractDS and Attribute are moved
          out of H5Object.  Class Attribute now multiply inherits from
          IdComponent and AbstractDs and class DataSet from H5Object and
          AbstractDs.  In addition, the data member IdComponent::id was
          moved into subclasses: Attribute, DataSet, DataSpace, DataType,
          H5File, Group, and PropList. BMR - 2008/08/10
        - IdComponent::dereference was incorrect and replaced as described
          in "New Features" section.
          BMR - 2008/08/10

Known Problems
==============
* We discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 tests
  with chunking storage with the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a Linux
  cluster at NCSA.
  Under some complex selection cases, 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  This only happens when turning on collective IO with chunking storage
  with some complex selections. We haven't found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use Independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this problem, change the following line in your code:
  H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);

  to
  H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);
 
  KY - 2007/08/24

* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) does not create h5pfc correctly. It
  does not include the -lmpi properly.  This will be fixed in the next
  release.  AKC - 2007/08/07.

* On IRIX64 6.5 (UCAR SGI mop1), when testing HDF5 tools with an HDF5 shared
  library, especially for h5repacktst and h52gifgentst, the following (or a
  similar) error message may appear:
  "523648:lt-h5repacktst: rld: Fatal Error: Cannot Successfully map soname
  'libh5test.so.1' under any of the filenames .......(bunch of directories)
  "
  And the testing will fail. 

  We believe this is a libtool problem. One way to get rid of this is to
  add the paths of libh5test.so.1 and libh5.so.1 to the shared library path.

  You may do this, under csh:
  setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH [full path of HDF5 directory/test/.libs]:[full 
  path of HDF5 directory/src/.libs]:(existing paths)...

  NOTE: This problem ONLY affects the testing of the HDF5 library when you 
  build from source. It won't affect any applications that would like to link 
  with the HDF5 shared library since the shared library path needs to be set 
  anyway.  KY - 2007/8/2

* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) failed the testpar/testphdf5 sub-test
  "calloc".  All other tests passed.  This indicates that a dataset using 
  chunked storage created by serial HDF5 may not work properly with parallel 
  HDF5.  The calloc test can be skipped by running "prun ... testphdf5 -x 
  calloc".  AKC - 2007/7/12.

* When testing parallel HDF5 with the C compiler version MIPSpro 7.4.3 on IRIX
  6.5, set the environment variable MPI_TYPE_MAX to be a bigger number, for 
  example 120000, in order to pass the complicated collective IO tests inside 
  the parallel HDF5 library. This is not a problem inside the parallel HDF5 
  library. You can always set a bigger number on your system.  KY - 2005/10/6

* A contiguous or chunked dataset created by a sequential version of HDF5 
  might not be able to be modified with a parallel version of the library. 
  Use the H5Pset_alloc_time function with H5D_ALLOC_TIME_EARLY to set up the 
  dataset creation property list to avoid the problem.  EIP - 2005/09/09

* A dataset created or rewritten with the v1.6.3 library or after can't 
  be read with the v1.6.2 library or before when Fletcher32 EDC (a filter) is 
  enabled.  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 
  checksum in the library before v1.6.3.  The checksum value wasn't consistent 
  between big-endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in 
  Release 1.6.3.  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value is no 
  longer the same as before on little-endian system.  HDF5 library releases 
  after 1.6.4 can still read datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 
  library of v1.6.2 or before.  SLU - 2005/7/8

* test/big fails sometimes with the message "Possible overlap with another
  region."  The test selects regions randomly, and this error occurs when
  two regions overlap each other; it is a bug in the test and not in
  HDF5.  Since the error is triggered by a random situation, it will
  usually disappear if the test is re-run.

* Newer SGI MIPSpro compilers (version 7.4.x) support C99 features but 
  have a "guard" statement in stdint.h that will #error and skip the rest
  of the header file if the C99 option is not used explicitly.  Hardsetting
  $CC to c99 will resolve the problem. AKC - 2004/12/13

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command poe.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may also fail with messages like "The socket name is already
  in use".  HDF5 does not use sockets.  This is due to problems of the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  Check whether there are 
  many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  These are sockets used by 
  the poe command and left behind due to failed commands.  Ask your system 
  administrator to clean them out.  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means 
  to run poe without the debug socket.

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the HPUX 11.00.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* Use the --disable-shared configure flag if building with an Absoft Fortran
  compiler.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8.

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the following test:
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 
  10**-308.  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 
  0.0, but occasionally appear as 10**-308.  This has been reported to the 
  system staff.

  All other tests have passed.

New Features
============
    Configuration:
    -------------------------
    '--enable-stream-vfd' and '--disable-stream-vfd' are no longer valid 
    configure options because the stream I/O driver has ben removed from
    the distribution.

    Source code distribution
    ========================
    Library:
    --------
    The stream I/O driver is not included with the HDF5 Library in this
    release.  The source code files hdf5/src/H5FDstream.c and
    hdf5/src/H5FDstream.h and the driver ENUM value H5FD_STREAM have been 
    removed.

    Parallel Library:

Support for New Platforms, Languages and Compilers
==================================================

No new platorms, languages, or compilers are supported in this release.


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.6 Release
==================================

    Library
    -------
        - H5Iget_name could not be used with an object identifier returned  
            by H5Rdereference; the function would not be able to determine 
            a valid object name.  It has been fixed.  SLU - 2008/1/30 
        - Changed library's behavior for reading files that might have
            corrupted object header information from a previous (buggy)
            version of the library.  By default, the library now rebuilds the
            correct object header information instead of issuing an error.
            Previous "strict" file format interpretation can be enabled with
            the "--enable-strict-format-checks" configure option.
            QAK - 2008/01/13
        - Fixed bug in H5Epush() which was clearing the error stack before
            pushing new error value.  QAK - 2007/08/23
        - Fixed bug in H5Ewalk() which was not passing back the return value
            from error stack walking callback.  QAK - 2007/08/23

Known Problems
==============
* We discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 tests
  with chunking storage with the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a Linux
  cluster at NCSA.
  Under some complex selection cases, 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  This only happens when turning on collective IO with chunking storage
  with some complex selections. We haven't found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use Independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this problem, change the following line in your code:
  H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);

  to
  H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);
 
  KY - 2007/08/24

* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) does not create h5pfc correctly. It
  does not include the -lmpi properly.  This will be fixed in the next
  release.  AKC - 2007/08/07.

* On IRIX64 6.5 (UCAR SGI mop1), when testing HDF5 tools with an HDF5 shared
  library, especially for h5repacktst and h52gifgentst, the following (or a
  similar) error message may appear:
  "523648:lt-h5repacktst: rld: Fatal Error: Cannot Successfully map soname
  'libh5test.so.1' under any of the filenames .......(bunch of directories)
  "
  And the testing will fail. 

  We believe this is a libtool problem. One way to get rid of this is to
  add the paths of libh5test.so.1 and libh5.so.1 to the shared library path.

  For 32-bit:
  You may do this, under csh:
  setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH .......(existing paths):[full path of HDF5
  directory/test/.libs]:[full path of HDF5 directory/src/.libs]

  For 64-bit:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH ......(existing paths):[full path of HDF5
  directory/test/.libs]:[full path of HDF5 directory/src/.libs]

  NOTE: This problem ONLY affects the testing of the HDF5 library when you 
  build from source. It won't affect any applications that would like to link 
  with the HDF5 shared library since the shared library path needs to be set 
  anyway.  KY - 2007/8/2

* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) failed the testpar/testphdf5 sub-test
  "calloc".  All other tests passed.  This indicates that a dataset using 
  chunked storage created by serial HDF5 may not work properly with parallel 
  HDF5.  The calloc test can be skipped by running "prun ... testphdf5 -x 
  calloc".  AKC - 2007/7/12.

* The Intel C Compiler for the Linux x86_64 platform (EM64T-based, v8.1) has
  an optimization error in the datatypes conversion code.  Before running
  configure, edit the file config/intel-flags by changing the setting of
  PROD_CFLAGS from -O3 to -O0.  Then run configure.  AKC - 2005/11/10.

* When testing parallel HDF5 with the C compiler version MIPSpro 7.4.3 on IRIX
  6.5, set the environment variable MPI_TYPE_MAX to be a bigger number, for 
  example 120000, in order to pass the complicated collective IO tests inside 
  the parallel HDF5 library. This is not a problem inside the parallel HDF5 
  library. You can always set a bigger number on your system.  KY - 2005/10/6

* A contiguous or chunked dataset created by a sequential version of HDF5 
  might not be able to be modified with a parallel version of the library. 
  Use the H5Pset_alloc_time function with H5D_ALLOC_TIME_EARLY to set up the 
  dataset creation property list to avoid the problem.  EIP - 2005/09/09

* A dataset created or rewritten with the v1.6.3 library or after can't 
  be read with the v1.6.2 library or before when Fletcher32 EDC (a filter) is 
  enabled.  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 
  checksum in the library before v1.6.3.  The checksum value wasn't consistent 
  between big-endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in 
  Release 1.6.3.  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value is no 
  longer the same as before on little-endian system.  HDF5 library releases 
  after 1.6.4 can still read datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 
  library of v1.6.2 or before.  SLU - 2005/7/8

* For version 6 (6.02 and 6.04) of the Portland Group compiler on AMD Opteron
  processor, there's a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  The library
  failed in several tests, all related to the multi driver.  The problem has 
  been reported to the vendor.  

* test/big fails sometimes with the message "Possible overlap with another
  region."  The test selects regions randomly, and this error occurs when
  two regions overlap each other; it is a bug in the test and not in
  HDF5.  Since the error is triggered by a random situation, it will
  usually disappear if the test is re-run.

* Newer SGI MIPSpro compilers (version 7.4.x) support C99 features but 
  have a "guard" statement in stdint.h that will #error and skip the rest
  of the header file if the C99 option is not used explicitly.  Hardsetting
  $CC to c99 will resolve the problem. AKC - 2004/12/13

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command poe.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may also fail with messages like "The socket name is already
  in use".  HDF5 does not use sockets.  This is due to problems of the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  Check whether there are 
  many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  These are sockets used by 
  the poe command and left behind due to failed commands.  Ask your system 
  administrator to clean them out.  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means 
  to run poe without the debug socket.

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the HPUX 11.00.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* Use the --disable-shared configure flag if building with an Absoft Fortran
  compiler.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8.

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the following test:
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 
  10**-308.  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 
  0.0, but occasionally appear as 10**-308.  This has been reported to the 
  system staff.

  All other tests have passed.

* On at least one system, SDSC DataStar, the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it
  for your installation.

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item
  on the command line which executes the test.  The script then
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF5 make files and test scripts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can
  prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However, on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.  JM - 2004/9/15

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.5 Release
==================================

    Library
    -------
        - Fixed several bugs with writing fill values for datasets that have
            a variable-length datatype or component datatype.  QAK - 2007/06/19
        - STDIO driver didn't support files bigger than 2GB because the OFFSET
            parameter of fseek is of type LONG INT, not big enough for big 
            files.  Use fseeko instead for big files if it's available on the 
            system.  SLU - 2007/4/5
        - Relaxed restrictions on attribute operations to allow a file ID to
            be used as the "location ID".  If a file ID is used, the attribute
            operation will occur on the root group of the file.
            QAK - 2007/02/09
        - Fixed a bug in H5Sselect_valid() that caused an incorrect value to
            be returned (0) instead of FAIL on error conditions such as the
            selection or extent not being defined. CMC - 2007/01/05
        - Fixed potential file corruption bug which could overwrite a portion
            of an object's header when an attribute was renamed.  If the new
            name for the attribute was longer than the old name, it was possible
            that the attribute would grow enough to overwrite another message
            in the object's header.  QAK - 2007/01/02
        - Fixed file corruption bug which could write an incorrect number of
            messages to an object's header under certain circumstances.
            Generally, the sequence of actions to generate this bug looks
            like this:
                - Create an object.
                - Close the file.
                - Re-open the file.
                - Add 2 (or more) attributes to the object.
                - Close the file.
                - Re-open the file.
                - Delete one of the attributes on the object.
                - Add a smaller attribute to the object.
                - Delete the smaller atttribute on the object.
                - Add a larger attribute on the object.

            After this, the number of header messages stored for the object
            will be off by one.  Other sequences of modifying attributes on an
            object could also trigger this bug.  If you are opening an
            object and the bottom few messages of the HDF5 error stack
            resembles the following, the object has been affected by this bug:

              #007: ../../hdf5_v1.6/src/H5C.c line 3887 in H5C_load_entry(): unable to load entry
                major(08): Meta data cache layer
                minor(40): Unable to load metadata into cache
              #008: ../../hdf5_v1.6/src/H5Ocache.c line 332 in H5O_load(): corrupt object header - too few messages
                major(12): Object header layer
                minor(40): Unable to load metadata into cache

            Specifically, "corrupt object header" is the best string to search
            for in the HDF5 error stack output.

            If your files have been affected by this bug, or you are concerned
            that your files might have been, please contact the HDF Helpdesk
            at help@hdfgroup.org for a tool to detect and repair files
            affected by this problem.  QAK - 2006/6/16

        - Fixed various problems with retrieving names of objects, especially
            with mounted files.  QAK - 2005/12/25

    Configuration
    -------------
        - Changed to default to --disable-shared if parallel is enabled. 
            AKC - 2007/5/12
        - Corrected a coding error in configure when it tries to locate the
          needed MPI and MPI-IO library for the fortran interface. 
            AKC - 007/5/9.
        - Changed default fortran compiler to g95 when gcc is used. 
            AKC - 007/2/17.
        - Configure can now use any tr command.  No more need for
            defining the variable TR, nor is it supported.  AKC - 2006/05/20

    Performance
    -------------
        - None
   
    Tools
    -----
        - Fixed a bug in h5dump regarding the display of named datatypes
            attributes. PVN - 2007/03/13
        - Fixed a bug in h5dump regarding the display of group comments. 
            PVN - 2007/03/13
        - Fixed a bug in h5dump regarding the display of hardlinks pointing 
            to the root group.  PVN - 2007/03/13
        - Fixed a bug in the h5diff percentage option -p.  PVN - 2007/03/05
        - Fixed a bug in h5dump that caused array indices greater than 2^32-1
            not to be printed correctly.  PVN - 2007/2/19

    Documentation 
    ------------- 
        - Corrected errors and extended the descriptions in Reference Manual 
            entries for several functions.  

    F90 API
    -------
        - None
                                
    C++ API
    -------
          - Changed
                  StrType::StrType(const size_t& size);
            to
                  StrType::StrType(const int dummy, const size_t& size);
            because the first one clashed with
                  StrType::StrType(const hid_t existing_id); - BMR 2007/05/03
          - Wrappers of H5Rcreate had incorrect prototypes.  Added these
            overloaded functions:
                  IdComponent::reference(void* ref, const char* name, DataSpace&
                          dataspace, H5R_type_t ref_type = H5R_DATASET_REGION)
                  IdComponent::void reference(void* ref, const char* name)
                  IdComponent::reference(void* ref, const H5std_string& name)
            and will remove these incorrect member functions:
                  DataSet::Reference
                  DataType::Reference
                  Group::Reference
                  H5File::Reference
          - Added wrappers for H5Rdereference as constructors:
                  DataSet(IdComponent& obj, void* ref);
                  Group(IdComponent& obj, void* ref);
                  DataType(IdComponent& obj, void* ref);

Compiler versions for each platform are listed in the "Platforms Tested" 
table found elsewhere in this file (RELEASE.txt).  Unless otherwise noted, 
compilers used are the system compilers.

Footnotes:
(1) Fortran compiled with g95.
(2) In most cases, shared libraries are provided only for the C library, 
    except on Windows where they are provided for C, C++, and Fortran.
(3) C++ works only with static libraries.


Known Problems
==============
* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) does not create h5pfc correctly. It
  does not include the -lmpi properly.  This will be fixed in the next
  release.  AKC - 2007/08/07.

* On IRIX64 6.5 (UCAR SGI mop1), when testing HDF5 tools with an HDF5 shared
  library, especially for h5repacktst and h52gifgentst, the following (or
  similar) error message may appear:
  "523648:lt-h5repacktst: rld: Fatal Error: Cannot Successfully map soname
  'libh5test.so.1' under any of the filenames .......(bunch of directories)
  "
  And the testing will fail. 
  We believe this is a libtool problem. One way to get rid of this is to
  add the paths of libh5test.so.1 and libh5.so.1 to the shared library path.

  For 32-bit:
  You may do this, under csh:
  setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH .......(existing pathes):[full path of HDF5
  directory/test/.libs]:[full path of HDF5 directory/src/.libs]

  For 64-bit:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH ......(existing pathes):[full path of HDF5
  directory/test/.libs]:[full path of HDF5 directory/src/.libs]

  NOTE: This problem ONLY affects the testing of the HDF5 library when you 
  build from source. It won't affect any applications that would like to link 
  with the HDF5 shared library since the shared library path needs to be set 
  anyway.  KY - 2007/8/2

* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) failed the testpar/testphdf5 sub-test
  "calloc".  All other tests passed.  This indicates that a dataset using 
  chunked storage created by serial HDF5 may not work properly with parallel 
  HDF5.  The calloc test can be skipped by running "prun ... testphdf5 -x 
  calloc".  AKC - 2007/7/12.

* The Intel C Compiler for the Linux x86_64 platform (EM64T-based, v8.1) has
  an optimization error in the datax types conversion code.  Before running
  configure, edit the file config/intel-flags by changing the setting of
  PROD_CFLAGS from -O3 to -O0.  Then run configure.  AKC - 2005/11/10.

* When testing parallel HDF5 with the C compiler version MIPSpro 7.4.3 on IRIX
  6.5, set the environment variable MPI_TYPE_MAX to be a bigger number, for 
  example 120000, in order to pass the complicated collective IO tests inside 
  the parallel HDF5 library. This is not a problem inside the parallel HDF5 
  library. You can always set a bigger number on your system.  KY - 2005/10/6

* A contiguous or chunked dataset created by a sequential version of HDF5 
  might not be able to be modified with a parallel version of the library. 
  Use the H5Pset_alloc_time function with H5D_ALLOC_TIME_EARLY to set up the 
  dataset creation property list to avoid the problem.  EIP - 2005/09/09

* The dataset created or rewritten with the v1.6.3 library or after can't 
  be read with the v1.6.2 library or before when Fletcher32 EDC (a filter) is 
  enabled.  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 
  checksum in the library before v1.6.3.  The checksum value wasn't consistent 
  between big-endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in 
  Release 1.6.3.  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value is no 
  longer the same as before on little-endian system.  The library release 
  after 1.6.4 can still read the dataset created or rewritten with the library
  of v1.6.2 or before.  SLU - 2005/7/8

* For version 6 (6.02 and 6.04) of the Portland Group compiler on AMD Opteron
  processor, there's a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  The library
  failed in several tests, all related to the multi driver.  The problem has 
  been reported to the vendor.  

* test/big fails sometimes with the message "Possible overlap with another
  region."  The test selects regions randomly, and this error occurs when
  two regions overlap each other; it is a bug in the test and not in
  HDF5.  Since the error is triggered by a random situation, it will
  usually disappear if the test is re-run.

* Newer SGI MIPSpro compilers (version 7.4.x) support C99 features but 
  have a "guard" statement in stdint.h that will #error and skip the rest
  of the header file if the C99 option is not used explicitly.  Hardsetting
  $CC to c99 will resolve the problem. AKC - 2004/12/13

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command poe.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may also fail with messages like "The socket name is already
  in use".  HDF5 does not use sockets (except for stream-VFD).  This is
  due to problems of the poe command trying to set up the debug socket.
  Check whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  These 
  are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed commands.
  Ask your system administrator to clean them out.  Lastly, request IBM
  to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the HPUX 11.00.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* The Stream VFD is not supported under Windows.

* Use the --disable-shared configure flag if building with Absoft Fortran
  compiler.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8.

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the following test:
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 
  10**-308.  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 
  0.0, but occasionally appear as 10**-308.  This has been reported to the 
  system staff.

  All other tests have passed.

* On at least one system, SDSC DataStar, the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it
  for your installation.

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item
  on the command line which executes the test.  The script then
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF5 make files and test scripts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can
  prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However, on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.  JM - 2004/9/15

CONTENTS
========
- New Features
- Support for New Platforms, Languages and Compilers
- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.4
- Documentation
- Platforms Tested
- Supported Configuration Features Summary
- Known Problems


New Features
============
    Configuration:
    -------------------------
	- Added yodconfigure, a configure tool, that patches up the configure
	  file to allow configure to launch executable via the proper
	  launching command like "yod -sz 1".  AKC - 2005/11/10
	- Configure now recognizes the TR variable as the location of the
          tr utility.  JML 2005/10/20

    Source code distribution:
    -------------------------
	- Added g95 as a testing "platform" informally. AKC - 2005/10/04.
        - Added MD5 checksumming to snapshot releases.  Releases will now
          produce an .md5 file as well as a .tar archive.  md5sum can be
          used to verify the arvhice with the .md5 checksum.  -JL 2005/09/06

    Library:
    --------
        - Added HSYS_ERROR which retrieves the system error message and pushes
          it to the error stack.  This provides more information regarding the 
	  failed system call. AKC - 2005/08/04
        - Added H5F_OBJ_LOCAL flag to H5Fget_obj_count() & H5Fget_obj_ids(), to
          allow querying for objects in a file that was opened with a particular
          file ID, instead of all objects opened in the file with any file ID.
          QAK - 2005/06/01

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
	- Added mpich2 as a testing "platform" informally. AKC - 2005/10/04.
	- HDF5 supports collective MPI-IO for irregular selection with HDF5
	  dataset. Irregular selection is when users use API H5Sselect_hyperslab
	  more than once for the same dataset.
	  Currently, not all MPI-IO packages support the complicated 
	  MPI derived datatypes used in the implementation of irregular 
	  selections INSIDE HDF5. 
	  1) DEC 5.x wdoes not support complicated derived datatypes.
	  2) For AIX 5.1:
	     If your poe version number is 3.2.0.20 or lower,
	     please edit powerpc-ibm-aix5.x in the directory hdf5/config/.
	     Find the line with
	          << hdf5_mpi_complex_derived_datatype_works >>
	     and UNCOMMENT this line before the configure.
	     check poe version with the following command:
	     lpp -l all | grep ppe.poe
	  3) For Linux cluster,:
	     If mpich version is 1.2.5 or lower, collective irregular selection
	     IO is not supported; internally independent IO is used.
	  4) For IRIX 6.5:
	     if C compiler version is 7.3 or lower, collective irregular 
	     selection IO is not supported; internally independent IO is used.
	  5) For platforms which internally used mpich: 
	     If the mpich version is 1.2.5 or lower, please find the 
	     corresponding config (in hdf5/config) file and add
	         hdf5_mpi_complex_derived_datatype_works='no' 
	     at the end of the configuration file. For example, on the 
	     NCSA SGI Altix, the internal mpich library is 1.2.5. So 
	         hdf5_mpi_complex_derived_datatype_works='no' 
	     should be added at the end of the config file ia64-linux-gnu.
	     KY - 2005/09/12

    Tools:
    ------
        - Removed obsolete pdb2hdf tool.  JML - 2005/10/28
        - Sped up h5dump on files with large numbers of objects.
            QAK - 2005/08/25

    F90 API:
    --------
        - Added missing h5tget_member_class_f function
                                            EIP 2005/04/06
    C++ API:
    --------
        - Added missing member functions:
		H5::CompType::getMemberArrayType
		H5::CompType::getMemberVarLenType
		H5::AbstractDs::getArrayType
		H5::AbstractDs::getVarLenType
		H5::CommonFG::openArrayType
		H5::CommonFG::openVarLenType
		H5::PropList::copyProp -- this will replace the current
			H5::PropList::copyProp in later releases due
			to incorrect prototype.
		BMR - 2005/07/27

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.4 Release
==================================

    Library
    -------
        - Fixed collective IO in chunking-storage.  HDF5 may have called the 
            wrong routine when the shape of the dataspace in the file and in 
            the bufferred chunk were different. This bug was fixed to make sure
            the correct routine is called. KY - 2005/10/19
        - Fixed core dump when closing root groups opened through two different
            file handles that operate on the same actual file.  QAK - 2005/10/02
        - The ./dsets tests used to fail in the TFLOPS machine if the
            test program, dsets.c, was compiled with the -O option.
            The HDF5 library still worked correctly with the -O option. Only
            the ./dsets failed.  It is fixed. AKC - 2005/09/14
        - Corrected errors when performing various operations on a group opened
            by dereferencing an object reference.  QAK - 2005/07/30
        - Fixed a bug with named datatypes where a copy of a named datatype
            used to create a dataset would accidentally use the original
            named datatype for the dataset's datatype.  QAK - 2005/07/23
        - Made H5Fget_name() to be consistent and always return name of actual
            file the ID is in.  (Instead of the name of the top file in a
            file mounting hierarchy).  QAK - 2005/07/19
        - Reworked internal file mounting semantics to hopefully eliminate
            mounting problems.  We now require that files that are mounting
            together all have the same "file close degree".  QAK - 2005/07/19
        - More bug fixes on holding open files that are mounted and have
            IDs open.  QAK - 2005/07/14
        - Dataset sieve buffer cache was inadvertantly disabled; it has been
            re-enabled.  QAK - 2005/07/08
        - Don't unmount child files until the parent file actually closes.
            (Previously, if an object was holding open a file, the child files
            would get unmounted too early).  QAK - 2005/07/05
        - Fixed bug where unmounted files could cause the library to go into
            an infinite loop when shutting down.  QAK - 2005/06/30
        - Fixed bug with hyperslab selections that use selection offsets and
            operate on chunked datasets going into infinite loop or dumping
            core.  QAK - 2005/06/17
        - Corrected memory leak and possible corruption when opening a group.
            QAK - 2005/06/17
        - Added check for opaque datatype tags being too long (check against
            H5T_OPAQUE_TAG_MAX, currently set to 256).  QAK - 2005/06/14
        - Fixed various errors in maintaining names for open objects in the
            face of unusual mount & unmount operations.  QAK - 2005/06/08
        - "SEMI" and "STRONG" file close degree settings now apply only to the
            particular file ID being closed, instead of operating on all open
            file IDs for a given file.  QAK - 2005/06/01
        - Fixed error in opening object in a group that was opened in a mounted
            file which has been unmounted.  QAK - 2005/03/17

    Configuration
    -------------
	- Configure can recognize -lmpich as a form of MPI library. -AKC-
	  2005/9/28.
	- Changed default C++ compiler for the IA64 platform from icc to
	    icpc which is the preferred compiler for Intel Compiler version
	    8. AKC - 2005/09/02

    Performance
    -------------
        - Optimized I/O for enumerated datatypes that are a superset of a 
            source enumerated datatype.  QAK - 2005/03/19

    ------------- 

    F90 API
    -------
       - h5pget_driver_f was returning information that could not be
         interpreted by a Fortran application program; fixed. EIP - 2005/04/10
                                
    C++ API
    -------
	- Several member functions' prototype changed due to the 
	  "int -> unsigned" change in the main library.  They are:
		H5::CompType::getMemberDataType(unsigned member_num)
		H5::CompType::getMemberCompType(unsigned member_num)
		H5::CompType::getMemberEnumType(unsigned member_num)
		H5::CompType::getMemberIntType(unsigned member_num)
		H5::CompType::getMemberFloatType(unsigned member_num)
		H5::CompType::getMemberStrType(unsigned member_num)

           FMB/EIP - 2005/11/10


Known Problems
==============
* Intel Compilers for Linux x86_86 platforms (EM64T-based, v8.1) has
  optimization error in the data types conversion code.  Before running
  configure, edit the file config/intel-flags by changing the setting of
  PROD_CFLAGS from -O3 to -O0, then run configure.  AKC - 2005/11/10.

* Fortran testing and compiling failures on windows XP 
  1. Compaq visual fortran 6.6c with VS 6.0
     The Fortran tests failed for both release, release dll, debug and debug
     dll. The failure is a random one. We won't provide fortran libraries. The
     same test passed with the 1.7.51 snapshot. You may find the 1.7.51 
     snapshot under ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/pub/outgoing/hdf5/snapshots/.
  2. Intel fortran 8.1 under .Net environment
     The fortran library cannot even be compiled. Some users have pointed this
     to intel forum.

* When testing parallel HDF5 with the C compiler version MIPSpro 7.4.3 at IRIX
  6.5, set enviroment variable MPI_TYPE_MAX to be a bigger number, for example 
  120000, in order to pass the complicated collective IO tests inside parallel 
  HDF5 library. This is not a problem inside parallel HDF5 library. You can 
  always set a bigger number in your system.
                                  KY - 2005/10/6

* A contiguous or chunked dataset created by a sequential version may
  not be modified with a parallel version of the library. 
  Use the H5Pset_alloc_time function with H5D_ALLOC_TIME_EARLY to set up the 
  dataset creation property list to avoid the problem.
                                    EIP - 2005/09/09

* The dataset created or rewritten with the v1.6.3 library or after can't 
  be read with the v1.6.2 library or before when Fletcher32 EDC(filter) is 
  enabled.  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 
  checksum in the library before v1.6.3.  The checksum value wasn't consistent 
  between big-endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in 
  Release 1.6.3.  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value is no 
  longer the same as before on little-endian system.  The library release 
  after 1.6.4 can still read the dataset created or rewritten with the library
  of v1.6.2 or before.  SLU - 2005/7/8

* For version 6 (6.02 and 6.04) of the Portland Group compiler on AMD Opteron
  processor, there's a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  The library
  failed in several tests but all related to multi driver.  The problem has 
  been reported to the vendor.  

* test/big fails sometimes with the message "Possible overlap with another
  region."  The test selects regions randomly, and this error occurs when
  two regions overlap each other; it is a bug in the test and not in
  HDF5.  Since the error is triggered by a random situation, it will
  usually disappear if the test is re-run.

* Newer SGI MIPSpro compilers (version 7.4.x) support C99 features but it
  has a "guard" statement in stdint.h that will #error and skip the rest
  of the header file if C99 option is not used explicitly.  Hardset
  $CC to c99 will resolve the problem. AKC - 2004/12/13

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command poe.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.
  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already
  in use".  HDF5 does not use sockets (except for stream-VFD).  This is
  due to problems of the poe command trying to set up the debug socket.
  Check if there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* staying around.  These are
  sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed commands.
  Ask your system administrator to clean them out.  Lastly, request IBM
  to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* Two h5dump xml tests(h5dump --xml thlink.h5 and h5dump --xml tmany.h5) 
  failed on windows xp with .NET for debug and debug dll. Release and 
  Release dll work fine. 

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the HPUX 11.00.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows.


* Before building HDF5 F90 Library from source on Crays 
  replace H5Aff.f90, H5Dff.f90 and H5Pff.f90 files in the fortran/src
  subdirectory in the top level directory with the Cray-specific files
  from the site:
  ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current/src/patches/

* Use --disable-shared configure flag if building with Absoft Fortran
  compiler.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8.

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 1**-308.
  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 0.0 but
  occasionally as 1**-308.  This has been reported to the system staff.
  All other tests have passed.

* Fortran release DLL randomly failed with Compaq Visual Fortran 6.6c on
  Windows. 

* Fortran DLL built with Intel 8.1 in .NET environment crushed the compiler,
  Building Fortran static library with Intel 8.1 in .NET environment 
  requires manually setting the project file.
  Please contact to hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu if you need to build
  Fortran static library with Intel 8.1 with .NET environment.

* On at least one system, SDSC DataStar, the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it
  for your installation.

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item
  on the command line which executes the test.  The script then
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF make files and test scripts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can
  prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However, on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.

- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.3
- Documentation
- Platforms Tested
- Supported Configuration Features Summary
- Known Problems


New Features
============
    Source code distribution:
    -------------------------

    The High-Level (HL) C APIs were added to the source code distribution.
    For HL documentation, see
    http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/hdf5_hl/doc/RM_hdf5hl.html.

    The HL library, libhdf5_hl.a(so), is built and installed by default. 
    Use --disable-hl configure flag to disable the HL library.

    Library:
    --------
        - We recommend you to use SZIP v2.0 with this release. 
          For more information see
          http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/ 
        - The compound datatype has been enhanced with a new feature of size 
            adjustment.  The size can be increased and decreased (without
            cutting the last member).  No API change is involved.  SLU - 
            2004/10/1
        - Removed PABLO support.  2005/01/20 EIP 

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
        - Allow compressed, chunked datasets to be read in parallel.
            QAK - 2004/10/04

    Tools:
    ------
	- New tool, h5jam.  See HDF5 Reference Manual.  2004/10/08	      

    F90 API:
    --------
          No new features in this release.

    C++ API:
    --------
	- Started using C library's reference counting in place of the class
	  RefCounter, which existed before the C mechanism was available.  
	  As a result, RefCounter has been removed.  2005/03/12 BMR


Support for new platforms, languages and compilers.
=======================================

    Configuration
    -------------
	- Upgraded from GNU autoconf 2.53 to autoconf 2.59.  JML - 2005/01/31


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.3 release
==================================

    Library
    -------
        - Fixed a racing condition in MPIPOSIX virtual file drive close
	  function.  Now all processes must completed the close before any
	  of them is returned.  This prevents some "faster" processes start
	  accessing the file for another purpose (e.g., open with truncate)
	  while other "slower" processes have not closed the same file with
	  the previous purpose.  AKC - 2005/03/01
	- H5Tget_member_value calls for enum datatype didn't return correct 
          value if H5Tenum_valueof was called first.  It's fixed.  SLU - 
          2005/02/08
        - For variable-length string, H5Tget_class returned H5T_STRING as its
          class.  But H5Tdetect_class and H5Tget_member_class considered it
          as H5T_VLEN.  This is fixed to let all these 3 functions treat it
          as H5T_STRING.  SLU - 2005/02/08
        - The byte order of all 1-byte integer types was fixed as
          little-endian even on a big-endian machine.  It's corrected.
          SLU - 2005/02/07
        - Fixed segmentation fault when calling H5Fflush with an attribute that
          hasn't had a value written to it open.  QAK - 2004/10/18
        - Backed out support for bitfield and time types in H5Tget_native_type.
          Leave it to future support.  The function simply returns error 
          message of "not support" for bitfield and time types. SLU - 2004/10/5
        - Fixed address check in Core VFL driver to avoid spurious address/size
          overflows for odd valued addresses and/or sizes.  QAK - 2004/09/27
        - Fixed problem where chunked datasets were not able to be deleted
          from a file under certain circumstances.  QAK - 2004/09/27/

    Configuration
    -------------
	- IRIX64 MIPSpro compiler of 7.4.x supports C99 features.  Default
	  to use the 'c99' compiler if available. AKC - 2004/12/13
	- Intel v8.0 compiler would infinite loop when compiling some test
	  code with -O3 option.  Changed enable-production default compiler
	  option to -O2. AKC - 2004/12/06
	- Long double is assumed to be a supported C data type.  It is a
	  standard C89 type. AKC - 2004/10/22

    Performance
    -------------
    Many changes were made to the library to improve performance,
    especially for the variable-length datatypes and metadata cache.
   
    Tools
    -----
        - h5fc and h5c++ work correctly when -c compiler flag
          is used.  EIP - 2005/03/14        
	- Fixed h5dump to print attributes data in ASCII if -r option is used.
	  AKC - 2004/11/18
        - Fixed space utilization reported in h5ls to correct error 
          in formula used.  QAK - 2004/10/22

    Documentation 
    ------------- 

    F90 API
    -------
       - On windows, previously Fortran DLL built and tested failed.
         Now Fortran DLL has been built and tested successfully
         with Dec Fortran 6.6c or Dec Fortran 6.0.

    C++ API
    -------


Documentation
=============

    HDF5 Library documentation
    --------------------------
    No substantive changes to the structure or types of content in the 
    HDF5 Library documentation.

    Windows installation documentation
    ----------------------------------
    1. On Windows zlib has been updated to 1.2.2. You may find the binary at
       either http://www.zlib.net/zlib122-dll.zip or
              ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/lib-external/zlib/bin/windows

    2. Only DLLs of external libraries (zlib and szip) are linked with the 
       HDF5 Library. We will no longer provide binary to link static library 
       with HDF5. For details, please check INSTALL_Windows in this directory.

Known Problems
==============
* test/big fails sometimes with the message "Possible overlap with another
  region."  The test selects regions randomly, and this error occurs when
  two regions overlap each other; it is an bug in the test and not in
  HDF5.  Since the error is triggered by a random situation, it will
  usually disappear if the test is re-run.

* Cray SV1 fails to correctly convert between floating-point and "long double"
  for software conversion.  Problem is being investigated. SLU - 2005/03/04

* Newer SGI MIPSpro compilers (version 7.4.x) support C99 features but it
  has a "guard" statement in stdint.h that will #error and skip the rest
  of the header file if C99 option is not used explicitly.  Hardset
  $CC to c99 will resolve the problem. AKC - 2004/12/13

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command poe.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.
  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already
  in use".  HDF5 does not use sockets (except for stream-VFD).  This is
  due to problems of the poe command trying to set up the debug socket.
  Check if there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* staying around.  These are
  sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed commands.
  Ask your system administrator to clean them out.  Lastly, request IBM
  to provide a mean to run poe without the debug socket.

* Fortran subroutine h5pget_driver_f doesn't return a correct driver 
  information.

* There are two h5dump xml tests(h5dump --xml thlink.h5 and 
  h5dump --xml tmany.h5) failed on windows xp with .NET for debug and 
  debug dll. Release and Release dll work fine. 

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows. It is not supported
  in the TFLOPS machine.

* The ./dsets tests failed in the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The hdf5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
    - Cray T90IEEE give errors during testing when displaying
      some floating-point values. These are benign differences due to
      the different precision in the values displayed.
      h5ls appears to be dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

* Before building HDF5 F90 Library from source on Crays 
  replace H5Aff.f90, H5Dff.f90 and H5Pff.f90 files in the fortran/src
  subdirectory in the top level directory with the Cray-specific files
  from the site:
  ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current/src/patches/

* On some platforms that use Intel and Absoft compilers to build HDF5 fortran 
  library, compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 and 
  fflush2.f90 complaining about exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error)

* Use --disable-shared configure flag if building with Absoft Fortran
  compiler

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 1**-308.
  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 0.0 but
  occasionally as 1**-308.  This has been reported to the system staff.
  All other tests have passed.

* The C++ library's tests fails when compiling with PGI C++ compiler.  The
  workaround until the problem is correctly handled is to use the
  flag "--instantiate=local" prior to the configure and build steps, as:
        setenv CXX "pgCC --instantiate=local"  for pgCC 5.02 and higher
        setenv CXX "pgCC -tlocal" for others

* Fortran release DLL randomly failed with compaq visual fortran 6.6c on
  windows. 

* Fortran DLL built with Intel 8.1 in .NET environment crushed the compiler,
  To build Fortran Static library with Intel 8.1 in .NET environment 
  needs manually setting the project file,
  please contact to hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu if you need to build
  fortran static library with Intel 8.1 with .NET environment.

* On at least one system, (SDSC DataStar), the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it
  for your installation.

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item
  on the command line which executes the test.  The script then
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF make files and test scripts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can
  can prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.

New Features
============

    Configuration:
    --------------
        - Added some initial support for making purify (or similar memory
            checking products) happier by initializing buffers to zero and
            disabling the internal free list code.  To take advantage of this,
            define 'H5_USING_PURIFY' in your CFLAGS when building the library.
            QAK - 2004/07/23

        - WINDOWS building,testing and installing improvements

          - On Windows, FORTRAN,C++ and C projects are merged into one zip file, 
            users can choose an option to build either FORTRAN or C++ or both 
            with basic C library.For detailed information,
            please read INSTALL_Windows.txt.

          - On Windows, szip compression library with or without encoder can be easily
            turned off or on when building HDF5.  For detailed information,
            please read INSTALL_Windows.txt, especially section V. 
  
          - On Windows, an optional procedure for building,testing and installing
            HDF5 from command line is provided. This procedure is supposed to be
            convenient for experienced users, please read 
            INSTALL_windows_From_Command_Line.txt for details.

          - On Windows, an alternative short instruction document for building,
            testing and installing HDF5 is provided. This instruction is supposed to
            be convenient for general users, please read 
            INSTALL_Windows_Short.txt for details.

          - On Windows, h5repack,h5diff,h5ls and h5import tool tests have been added.
          KY - 2004/9/16
  

    Library:
    --------
        - Modified the way how HDF5 calculates 'pixels_per_scanline' parameter for
          SZIP compression. Now there is no restriction on the size and shape of the 
          chunk except that the total number of elements in the chunk cannot be 
          bigger than 'pixels_per_block' parameter provided by the user.
                                                                    EIP - 2004/07/21 
        - HDF5 can now link to SZIP with or without szip's encoder.
          The new API function H5Zget_filter_info can be used to check
          szip's status.  Attempting to assign szip to a dataset property
          list or attempting to write with szip will generate an error if
          szip's encoder is disabled.  JL/NF - 2004/6/30
        - SZIP always uses K13 compression.  This flag no longer needs to
          be set when calling H5Pset_szip.  If the flag for CHIP
          compression is set, it will be ignored (since the two are mutually
          exclusive).  JL/NF - 2004/6/30
        - A new API function H5Fget_name was added.  It returns the name
          of the file by object(file, group, data set, named data type,
          attribute) ID.  SLU - 2004/06/29
        - A new API function H5Fget_filesize was added.  It returns the
          actual file size of the opened file.  SLU - 2004/06/24
	- Added option that if $HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK is set to 2,
	  will suppress all library version mismatch warning messages.
	  AKC - 2004/4/14

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------

    Tools:
    ------
        - h5repack was added to the tools suite. h5repack regenerates an HDF5 file 
	  from another HDF5 file, optionally applying HDF5 filters (compression) 
	  and/or chunking to the copied file. The filters options are read from 
	  the command line. See /doc/html/Tools.html for more details.
	  PVN - 2004/9/13

        - h5dump includes new features:
           1) Printing of dataset filters, storage layout and fill value information.
           2) Print a list of the file contents.
	   3) Escape non printing characters.
	   4) Print the content of the boot block.
	   5) Print array indices with the data (the default).
	  These options are all switch controlled. See /doc/html/Tools.html for more details.
	  PVN - 2004/9/13
	      

    F90 API:
    --------
        - added new subroutines:
                h5fget_filesize_f
                h5iget_file_id_f
                h5premove_filter_f
                h5zget_filter_info_f
                                         EIP 2004/9/21
 
        - added new h5fget_name_f and h5fget_filesize_f subroutines
                                         EIP 2004/07/08

    C++ API:
    --------
	- Added wrappers for array and variable length datatypes APIs
	- Added wrappers for newly added APIs from H5T, H5F, and H5I
	- Added many wrappers that were missing from the H5P API
	- Added the ability to reference HDF5 objects to these classes:
	  DataSet, DataType, Group, and H5File (wrappers for H5R APIs)
	BMR 2004/08/04


Support for new platforms, languages and compilers.
=======================================
        - Added PGI Fortran support for Linux64 (x86_64) systems
                            EIP - 2004/08/19
        - Absoft compiler f95 v9.0 is supported on Linux 2.4 32bit
                            EIP - 2004/07/29 
        - HDF5 Fortran APIs are supported on Mac OSX with IBM XL Fortran
          compiler version 8.1. This is a default compiler.
        - HDF5 Fortran APIs are supported on MAC OSX with Absoft F95 compiler
          version 8.2; set F9X environment variable to f95, for example
          setenv F9X f95
          Use --disable-shared --enable-static configure flags when Absoft
          compiler is used.
                             EIP - 2004/07/27

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.2 release
==================================

    Library
    -------
	- Fixed parallel bug in which some processes attempted collective
	  I/O while others did independent I/O.  Bug appeared when some
	  processes used point selections, and others didn't.  JRM - 2004/9/15
        - Corrected error where dataset region references were written in an
          incorrect way on Cray machines.  PVN & QAK - 2004/09/13
        - The H5Tget_native_type now determines the native type for integers
          based on the precision. This is to avoid cases of wrongly converting        
          an int to a short in machines that have a short of 8 bytes but with
	  32bit precision (e.g Cray SV1). PVN - 2004/09/07 
        - Changed H5Dread() to not overwrite data in an application's buffer
          with garbage when accessing a chunked dataset with an undefined fill
          value and an unwritten chunk is uncountered.  QAK - 2004/08/25
        - Fixed error which could cause a core dump when a type conversion
          routine was registered after a compound datatype had been
          converted and then an equivalent compound datatype was converted
          again.  QAK - 2004/08/07
        - Fixed memory overwrite when encoding "multi" file driver information
          for file's superblock.  QAK - 2004/08/05
        - Fixed obscure bug where a filter which failed during chunk allocation
          could allow library to write uncompressed data to disk but think
          the data was compressed.  QAK - 2004/07/29
        - Fixed bug where I/O to an extendible chunked dataset with zero-sized
          dimensions would cause library to fail an assertion.
          QAK - 2004/07/27
        - Fixed bug where chunked datasets which have filters defined,
          allocation time set to "late" and whose chunks don't align with
          the dataspace bounds could have incorrect data stored when
          overwriting the entire dataset on the first write.  QAK - 2004/07/27
        - Added check to ensure that dataspaces have extents set. JML-2004/07/26
        - Fixed bug on some Solaris systems where HDF5 would try to use
          gettimeofday() when that function didn't work properly.
          JML - 2004/07/23
        - Fixed bug in H5Sset_extent_simple where setting maximum size to
          non-zero, then to zero would cause an error.  JML - 2004/07/20
        - Allow NULL pointer for buffer parameter to H5Dread & H5Dwrite
          when not writing data ("none" selection or hyperslab or point
          selection with no elements defined).  QAK - 2004/07/20
        - Calling H5Gcreate() on "/" or "." throws an error instead of
          failing quietly. JML - 2004/07/19
        - Fixed bug where setting file address size to be very small could
          trigger an assert if the file grew to more than 64 KB.  Now throws
          an error and data can be recovered. JL/NF - 2004/07/14
        - Fixed bug where "resurrecting" a dataset was failing.
          QAK - 2004/07/14
        - Fixed bug where incorrect data could be read from a chunked dataset
          after it was extended.  QAK - 2004/07/12
        - After compound datatype with variable-length string in the fields
          is committed to file, the size is messed up when it's read back.
          Fixed.  SLU - 2004/06/11
        - Fixed potential file corruption bug when a block of metadata could
          overlap the end of the internal metadata accumulator buffer and
          the buffer would be extended correctly, but would incorrectly 
          change it's starting address.  QAK - 2004/06/09
        - Opaque datatype with no tag failed for some operations.  Fixed.
          SLU - 2004/6/3
        - Fixed potential file corruption bug where dimensions that were
          too large (a value greater than could be represented in 32-bits)
          could cause the incorrect amount of space to be allocated in a
          file for the raw data for the dataset.  QAK - 2004/06/01
	- Fixed dtypes "sw long double -> double" failure in QSC class
	  machines.  AKC - 2004/4/16

    Configuration
    -------------
        - Fixed the long compile time of H5detect.c when v7.x Intel Compiler
	  is used with optimization NOT off.  AKC - 2004/05/20

    Performance
    -------------

    Tools
    -----
        - On SGI h5dump displayed only part of the data due to the bug
          in the system printf; fixed.
                                             EIP - 2004/09/21 
    Documentation 
    ------------- 
        - Several descriptive errors have been fixed throughout the 
          documentation, particularly in the reference manual (RM).
          A selection particularly worthy of note would be these: 
        - The H5Pset_szip description in the RM has been expanded and
          corrected to facilitate use of SZIP compression.
        - A note has been added to the H5Dcreate description that an
          unexplained failure is likely to be due to a property list error 
          that is detected only at the time of dataset creation.
        -
        FMB - 2004/09/21

    F90 API
    -------
    
    Fortran functions h5dwrite/read_f and h5awrite/read_f do not
    accept dims parameter of INTEGER type anymore. Code was removed.
                                                    2004/04/15
    C++ API
    -------
	- H5::Exception's and its subclasses' constructors that were 
	  overloaded to take char pointers are removed and constructors
	  that passed in reference of 'string' are changed to pass 
	  by value.  In addition, the default value of the data member
	  H5::Exception::detailMessage is changed from 0/NULL to 
	  DEFAULT_MSG ("No detailed information provided".)
	- Prototype for DSetCreatPropList::setLayout is changed: 1st parameter
          is removed because it was there only by mistake.

    ----------------------------------
        -  INSTALL_Windows.txt has been enhanced to include instructions building 
           HDF5 with FORTRAN and C++. 
        -  Two optional installation documents have been added. They are
           INSTALL_Windows_Short.txt and INSTALL_Windows_From_Command_Line.txt.
           INSTALL_Windows_Short.txt is supposed to help general users who
           only want to build,test and install HDF5 in a quick way.
           INSTALL_Windows_From_Command_Line.txt is supposed to help users who
           would like to compile,test and install HDF5 in command line environment.
        -  INSTALL_Windows_withcpp.txt and INSTALL_Windows_withF90.txt became
           obsolete. Files are deleted from the release_docs directory.

Known Problems
==============
* h5fc and h5c++ compilation scripts have a bug: object files (*.o) cannot be
  created when source code is compiled using h5fc or h5c++. We will provide
  a fix. Please check ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current/src/patches/ 
  for the patches.

* Fortran subroutine h5pget_driver_f doesn't return a correct driver information.

* There are two h5dump xml tests(h5dump --xml thlink.h5 and h5dump --xml tmany.h5)
  failed on windows xp with .NET for debug and debug dll. Release and Release
  dll work fine. 

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows. It is not supported
  in the TFLOPS machine.

* The ./dsets tests failed in the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The hdf5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
    - Cray J90 and Cray T90IEEE give errors during testing when displaying
      some floating-point values. These are benign differences due to
      the different precision in the values displayed and h5ls appears to
      be dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

* Before building HDF5 F90 Library from source on Crays 
  replace H5Aff.f90, H5Dff.f90 and H5Pff.f90 files in the fortran/src
  subdirectory in the top level directory with the Cray-specific files
  from the site:
  ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current/src/patches/

* On some platforms that use Intel and Absoft compilers to build HDF5 fortran library,
  compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 and fflush2.f90
  complaining about exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error)

* On IA32 and IA64 systems, if you use a compiler other than GCC (such as
  Intel's ecc or icc compilers), you will need to modify the generated
  "libtool" program after configuration is finished. On or around line 104 of
  the libtool file, there are lines which look like:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl=""

  change these lines to this:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl="-Wl,"

  UPDATE: This is now done automatically by the configure script. However, if
  you still experience a problem, you may want to check this line in the
  libtool file and make sure that it has the correct value.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 1**-308.
  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 0.0 but
  occasionally as 1**-308.  This has been reported to the system staff.
  All other tests have passed.

* On at least one system, (SDSC DataStar), the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it
  for your installation.

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item
  on the command line which executes the test.  The script then
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

  You get the HDF make files and test scripts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can
  can prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.

New Features
============

    Configuration:
    --------------
        - Default of $prefix is changed to $PWD/hdf5 so that multiple
	  builds using --srcdir is possible in the same machine.
	  AKC - 2003/12/1

    Library:
    --------
        - Added H5Iget_ref, H5Iinc_ref and H5Idec_ref routines to the C
          library and the FORTRAN wrapper.  See the reference manual for a
          full description of these new routines.  QAK - 2003/12/11

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
	- The parallel tests in testpar/ now provides different levels of
	  verbosity via the '-v' option.  The default is less verbose
	  than before.  AKC - 2004/01/23
        - Added parallel test, test_mpio_1wMr, which tests if the
          underlaying parallel I/O system is conforming to the POSIX
          write/read requirement. This version includes options of using
          atomicity and file-sync.  AKC - 2003/11/27

    Tools:
    ------
        - Added option -showconfig to compiler tools (h5cc,h5fc,h5c++).
	  AKC - 2004/01/08
	- Install the "h5cc" and "h5fc" tools as "h5pcc" and "h5pfc"
	  respectively if library is built in parallel mode.  AKC - 2004/01/07
        - Added metadata benchmark (perform/perf_meta).  SLU - 2003/10/03

    C++ API:
    --------


Support for new platforms, languages and compilers.
=======================================
        - HDF5 Fortran APIs are supported on MAC OSX with IBM XL Fortran compiler
          version 8.1 Beta  
          Use --disbale-shared --enable-static flags with configure when 
          building HDF5 Fortran Library on MAC OSX.
        - C and C++ Libraries are available for Linux64 RH8
        - C, C++ and Fortran sequential Libraries, and C and Fortran parallel
          Libraries are available for Altix (Linux ia64)

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.1 release
==================================

    Library
    -------
        - Fixed problem with H5Tget_native_type() not handling opaque fields
            correctly.  QAK - 2004/01/31
        - Fixed several errors in B-tree deletion code which could cause a
            B-tree (used with groups and chunked datasets) to become corrupt
            with the right sequence of deleted objects.  QAK - 2004/01/19
        - Fixed small internal memory leaks of fill-value information.
            QAK - 2004/01/13
        - Fixed bug that caused variable-length datatypes (strings or sequences)
            used for datasets in files with objects that were unlinked to
            fail to be read/written to a file.  QAK - 2004/01/13
        - Detect situation where szip 'pixels per block' is larger than the
            fastest changing dimension of a dataset's chunk size and disallow
            this (due to limits in szip library).  QAK - 2003/12/31
        - Fixed bug with flattened hyperslab selections that would generate
            incorrect hyperslab information with certain high-dimensionality
            combinations of start/stride/count/block information.
            QAK - 2003/12/31
        - Fixed bug with variable-length datatypes used in compound datatypes.
            SLU - 2003/12/29
        - Fixed bug in parallel I/O routines that would cause reads from
            "short datasets" (datasets which were only partially written out)
            to return invalid data.  QAK & AKC - 2003/12/19
        - Fixed bug where scalar dataspaces for attributes were reporting as
            simple dataspaces.  QAK - 2003/12/13
        - Fixed problem with selection offsets of hyperslab selections in
            chunked datasets causing the library to go into an infinite loop.
            QAK - 2003/12/13
        - Fixed H5Giterate to avoid re-using index parameter after iteration
            callback has been called (allows iteration callback to modify the
            index parameter itself).  QAK - 2003/12/06
        - Fixed various floating-point conversion problems, including a
            change which could corrupt data when converting from double->float.
            QAK - 2003/11/24
        - Changed "single process" metadata writing in library to collective
            I/O by all processes, in order to guarantee correct data being
            written with MPI-I/O.  QAK - 2003/11/20
        - Fixed problems with fill values and variable-length types and also
            I/O on VL values that were set to NULL.  QAK - 2003/11/08
        - Fixed problems with MPI datatypes that caused ASCI Q machine to
            hang.  QAK - 2003/10/28
        - Removed HDF5_MPI_PREFER_DERIVED_TYPES environment variable support,
            since it had no benefit.  QAK - 2003/10/28
        - Single hyperslab selections (which were set with only one call to
            H5Sselect_hyperslab) that had dimensions that could be "flattened"
            but were interspersed with dimensions that could not be flattened
            were not correctly handled, causing core dumps.  QAK - 2003/10/25
        - Avoid metadata cache from preempting current dataset object header
            when looking up information about the named datatype that the
            dataset uses.  QAK - 2003/10/20

    Configuration
    -------------
        - Parallel I/O with the MPI-I/O driver will no longer work if the
            filesystem is not POSIX compliant.  The "HDF5_MPI_1_METAWRITE"
            environment variable has been removed.  QAK - 2004/01/30

    Performance
    -------------
        - More optimizations to inner loops of datatype conversions for
            integers and floats which give a 10-50% speedup.  QAK - 2003/11/07
        - Hoisted invariant 'if/else's out of inner datatype conversion loop for
            integer and floating-point values, giving about a 20% speedup.
            QAK - 2003/10/20

    Tools
    -----
	- Fixed h5redeploy which sometimes complain too many argument for the
	  test command. (The complain did not hinder the h5redploy to proceed
	  correctly.) AKC - 2003/11/03

Known Problems
==============
* Fortran subroutine h5pget_driver_f doesn't return a correct driver information.

* There are two h5dump xml tests(h5dump --xml thlink.h5 and h5dump --xml tmany.h5)
  failed on windows xp with .NET for debug and debug dll. Release and Release
  dll work fine. 

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows. It is not supported
  in the TFLOPS machine.


* The ./dsets tests failed in the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The hdf5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
    - Cray J90 and Cray T90IEEE give errors during testing when displaying
      some floating-point values. These are benign differences due to
      the different precision in the values displayed and h5ls appears to
      be dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

* Before building HDF5 F90 Library from source on Crays 
  replace H5Aff.f90, H5Dff.f90 and H5Pff.f90 files in the fortran/src
  subdirectory in the top level directory with the Cray-specific files
  from the site:
  ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/pub/outgoing/hdf5/hdf5-1.6.2/F90_source_for_Crays

* On some platforms that use Intel compilers to build HDF5 fortran library,
  compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 and fflush2.f90
  complaining about exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error)

* On IA32 and IA64 systems, if you use a compiler other than GCC (such as
  Intel's ecc or icc compilers), you will need to modify the generated
  "libtool" program after configuration is finished. On or around line 104 of
  the libtool file, there are lines which look like:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl=""

  change these lines to this:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl="-Wl,"

  UPDATE: This is now done automatically by the configure script. However, if
  you still experience a problem, you may want to check this line in the
  libtool file and make sure that it has the correct value.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 1**-308.
  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 0.0 but
  occassionaly as 1**-308.  This has been reported to the system staff.
  All other tests have passed.

* On AIX 5.1 when 64-bit parallel C Library is built with zlib configured in,
  compilation fails for H5Zdeflate.c. To bypass the problem, remove "const"
  definition in front of H5Z_DEFLATE in H5Zpkg.h line 29.

New Features
============

    Configuration:
    --------------

    Library:
    --------
        - Added new fields to the H5G_stat_t for more information about an
            object's object header.  QAK 2003/10/06
        - Added new H5Fget_freespace() routine to query the free space in a
            given file.  QAK 2003/10/06

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------

    Tools:
    ------

    C++ API:
    --------
        - Added overloaded functions read and write to H5::Attribute.
          BMR - 2003/04/21
        - Added an overloaded constructor H5::StrType so the need to separately
          set the length of the string type can be eliminated. BMR - 2003/04/21
        - Added overloaded functions read and write to H5::DataSet.
          BMR - 2003/04/27

        The following items were added but not documented in previous releases:

        - On windows, any application, that uses the C++ API dll, must
          include the name HDF5CPP_USEDLL in its project setting. (Feb 17, 2002)
          BMR - 2003/10/10
        - Added missing default constructor H5::H5File. (Apr 26, 2002)
          BMR - 2003/10/10
        - Added new member function H5::DataSet::fillMemBuf per the new C
          API H5Dfill, which fills the elements in a selection for a memory
          buffer with a fill value. (May 16, 2002) BMR - 2003/10/10
        - Added the new member function getMemberIndex to H5::EnumType
          and H5::CompType to match the new C API H5Tget_member_index.  Given
          the name of a member of an enumeration or compound datatype, this
          new function queries the index of the member. (May 16, 2002)
          BMR - 2003/10/10
        - Added these member functions to H5::Group per the new C functions
          H5Gget_num_objs, H5Gget_objname_by_idx and H5Gget_objtype_by_idx:
          + getNumObjs: Returns the number of objects in the group.
          + getObjnameByIdx: Retrieves the name of an object in a group,
                             given an index
          + getObjTypeByIdx: Returns the type of an object in a group,
                             given an index
          (Jan 20, 2003) BMR - 2003/10/10


Support for new platforms, languages and compilers.
=======================================
         - gcc 3.3.1 is supported on Linux.
  

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.0 release
==================================

    Library
    -------
        - Fixed incorrect datatype of the third parameter to the Fortran90
          h5pset(get)_cache_f functions (INTEGER to INTEGER(SIZE_T)) EIP - 2003/10/13
        - Fixed problems with accessing variable-length data datatypes on
            Crays.  QAK - 2003/10/10
        - Fixed potential file corruption bug when too many object header
            messages (probably attributes, from a user perspective) were
            inserted into an object header and certain other conditions were
            met.  QAK - 2003/10/08
        - Changed implementation of internal ID searching algorithm to avoid
            O(n) behavior for many common cases.  QAK - 2003/10/06
        - Allow partial parallel writing to compact datasets.  QAK - 2003/10/06
        - Correctly create reference to shared datatype in attribute, instead
            of making a copy of the shared datatype in the attribute.
            QAK - 2003/10/01
        - Revert changes which caused files >2GB to fail when created with
            MPI-I/O file driver on certain platforms.  QAK - 2003/09/16
        - Allow compound datatypes to grow in size.  SLU - 2003/09/10
        - Detect if a type is already packed before attempting to pack it
            again or check if it is locked.  SLU - 2003/09/10
        - Corrected bug when opening a file twice with read-only permission
            for one open and then closing the read-only access file ID would
            generate an error.  QAK - 2003/09/10
        - Corrected bug in repeated calls to H5Pget_access_plist() which would
            incorrectly manage reference counts of internal information and
            eventually blow up.  QAK - 2003/09/02
        - Return rank of the array datatype on successful call to
            H5Tget_array_dims().  QAK - 2003/08/30
        - Corrected bug in H5Tdetect_class which was not correctly detecting
            datatype classes of fields in nested compound datatypes in some
            circumstances.  QAK - 2003/08/30
        - Corrected bug in sieve buffer code which could cause loss of data
            when a small dataset was created and deleted in quick succession.
            QAK - 2003/08/27
        - Corrected bug in H5Gget_objname_by_idx which was not allowing NULL
            for the name when just querying for the object name's length.
            QAK - 2003/08/25
        - Corrected bug in variable-length string handling which could
            generate a core dump on writing variable-length strings as part
            of a compound datatype on certain architectures.  QAK - 2003/08/25
        - Corrected bug in H5Tget_native_type which would incorrectly compute
            the size of certain compound datatypes and also incorrectly
            compute the offset of the last field for those compound datatypes.
            QAK - 2003/08/25
        - Corrected bug in H5Tget_native_type which would drop string datatype
            metadata (padding, etc.)  QAK - 2003/08/25
        - Corrected bugs in H5Gget_num_objs, H5Gget_objname_by_idx and
            H5Gget_objtype_by_idx to allow them to accept location IDs, not just
            group IDs.  QAK - 2003/08/21
        - Corrected bug when using scalar dataspace for memory selection and
            operating on chunked dataset.  QAK - 2003/08/18
        - Corrected bugs with multiple '/' characters in names for H5Glink
            and H5Gunlink.  QAK - 2003/08/16
        - Corrected bug with user blocks that didn't allow a user block to
            be inserted in front of a file after the file was created.
            QAK - 2003/08/13
        - Corrected errors with using point selections to access data in
            chunked datasets.  QAK - 2003/07/23
        - Corrected error with variable-length datatypes and chunked datasets
            which caused H5Dwrite to fail sometimes.  QAK - 2003/07/19
        - Modified library and file format to support storing indexed storage
            (chunked dataset) B-tree's with non-default internal 'K' values.
            QAK - 2003/07/15
        - Returned H5T_BKG_TEMP support to library after it was accidentally
            removed.  QAK - 2003/07/14

    Configuration
    -------------
        - Fixed the error that caused "make install" to fail because of the
            macro definition syntax of "prefix?=..."  AKC - 2003/07/22

    Performance
    -------------

    Tools
    -----
	- Fixed a segmentation fault of h5diff when percentage option is used.
            AKC - 2003/08/27
        - Switched away from tools using internal "fixtype" function(s) to use
            H5Tget_native_type() internally.  QAK - 2003/08/25

    Documentation 
    ------------- 
        - Added two missing Fortran APIs (h5pget_fapl_mpiposix_f and 
            h5pset_fapl_mpiposix_f) to the reference manual.
            FMB - 2003/10/15
        - Corrected the reference manual descriptions of H5open/h5open_f and 
            H5close/h5close_f to indicate that these calls are required in 
            Fortran90 applications.   FMB - 2003/10/15


Documentation
=============

    Fortran90 APIs are being integrated into the main body of the 
    HDF5 Reference Manual (RM).  This process is complete in all RM sections
    except H5P.

    A PDF version of the RM will be posted on the HDF5 website
    (at http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/PSandPDF/) approximately one week
    after the release.

Known Problems
==============
* Fortran subroutine h5pget_driver_f doesn't return a correct driver information.
  The fix willl be available in the 1.6.2 release. 
* There are two h5dump xml tests(h5dump --xml thlink.h5 and h5dump --xml tmany.h5)
  failed on windows xp with .NET for debug and debug dll. Release and Release
  dll work fine. 

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF 5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
  compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
  able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

        warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
  This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.


* The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows. It is not supported
  in the TFLOPS machine.


* The ./dsets tests failed in the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The hdf5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
    - Cray J90 and Cray T90IEEE give errors during testing when displaying
      some floating-point values. These are benign differences due to
      the different precision in the values displayed and h5ls appears to
      be dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

* Before building HDF5 F90 Library from source on Crays 
  replace H5Aff.f90, H5Dff.f90 and H5Pff.f90 files in the fortran/src
  subdirectory in the top level directory with the Cray-specific files
  from the site:

* On some platforms that use Intel compilers to build HDF5 fortran library,
  compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 and fflush2.f90
  complaining about exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error)

  ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/pub/outgoing/hdf5/hdf5-1.6.0/F90_source_for_Crays

* On IA32 and IA64 systems, if you use a compiler other than GCC (such as
  Intel's ecc or icc compilers), you will need to modify the generated
  "libtool" program after configuration is finished. On or around line 104 of
  the libtool file, there are lines which look like:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl=""

  change these lines to this:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl="-Wl,"

  UPDATE: This is now done automatically by the configure script. However, if
  you still experience a problem, you may want to check this line in the
  libtool file and make sure that it has the correct value.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8

New Features
============

Configuration:
--------------
The following flags have been added to the configuration script:
--enable-hdf5v1_4       Compile the HDF5 v1.4 compatibility interface
--enable-filters=all    Turn on all internal I/O filters. One may also
                        specify a comma-separated list of filters or the
                        word no. The default is all internal I/O filters.
--with-mpe=DIR          Use MPE instrumentation [default=no]
--with-szlib=DIR        Use szlib library for external szlib I/O filter
                        [default=no]

Library:
--------
    Summary: This release has the following new features that are not
             available in 1.4.* releases

    1. Generic properties to give application more control on I/O pipeline
    2. Time allocation and fill value properties
    3. New  filters: external compression filter szip
                     internal shuffling and checksum filters
    4. Compact storage layout for datasets
    5. Redesigned I/O pipeline for better performance.

    For more information see
    http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc_resource/SZIP/index.html
    http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ADGuide.html
    http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/Changes.html 
    
    Complete list of changes:

    * Changed dataset modification time to _not_ be updated when raw data is
      written to a dataset.  The modification time is only updated when the
      dataset's metadata is modified.  QAK - 2003/06/10
    * Changed H5Sget_select_bounds to use 'hssize_t *' for start and end
      parameters, instead of 'hsize_t *', to better match other parts of the
      dataspace API.  QAK - 2003/06/04
    * Changed raw data I/O to only access each chunk once, improving performance
      in many situations with hyperslabs and large chunks or chunks with
      filters.  These improvements are currently limited to serial I/O, with
      similar parallel I/O improvements forthcoming sometime in the future.
      QAK - 2003/05/07
    * Added parameter to the MPI/POSIX driver. If GPFS is enabled (by
      modifying the H5FDmpiposix.c file to uncomment the USE_GPFS_HINTS
      macro), then this extra parameter will turn GPFS hints on and off
      during runtime. BW - 2003/05/05
    * Added option to print 1-byte integer datasets as ASCII to h5dump. BW -
      2003/04/30
    * Added a new utility "h5fc". It can be used to compile easily Fortran
      programs which use HDF5. It automatically uses the compiler the HDF5
      library was built with and links in any libraries HDF5 requires.
      BW - 2003/04/10
    * Added new dataset creation property list functions for working with
      I/O filters: H5Pmodify_filter, H5Pget_filter_by_id and
      H5Pall_filters_avail.  Also changed H5Zregister to use new method
      of registering filters with library.  QAK - 2003/04/08
    * The first version of szip compression support were implemented. 
      User should have static szlib library installed. Using function
      H5Pset_szip to pass the szip parameters to the HDF5 library.
      More detailed decription of the process will be followed.
      KY-2003/04/01
    * Added Fletcher32 checksum as a filter in pipeline.  It only works in 
      chunked dataset.  SLU - 2003/2/11
    * MPICH/MPE instrumentation feature added.  Use --with-mpe[=DIR] to configure
      it.  AKC - 2003/1/3
    * New functions H5Gget_num_objs, H5Gget_objname_by_idx and H5Gget_objtype_by_idx 
      are added to the library.  SLU - 2002/11/25
    * H5Dget_offset is added to return the offset of a dataset's data relative
      to the beginning of the file.  SLU - 2002/11/7
    * Functions H5Tget_native_type and H5Tis_variable_str are added.  The first
      one reconstructs a datatype based on native memory datatype.  The second
      one checks if a datatype is variable string.  SLU - 2002/11/6
    * Added environment variable "HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK", which disables
      the version checking between the header files and the library linked into
      an application if set to '1'.  This should be used with caution, mis-
      matched headers and library binaries can cause _serious_ problems.
      QAK - 2002/10/15
    * Added new API function to get the name of an object in a file, using
      an open ID (hid_t).  QAK - 2002/10/14
    * Added API functions to return pointer to low-level file handle
      (H5Fget_vfd_handle and H5FDget_vfd_handle) and related property list
      setting functions(H5Pset_family_offset and H5Pset_multi_type).
      SLU - 2002/09/30
    * Changed "H5P[set|get]_space_time" functions to "H5P[set|get]_alloc_time"
      Unify all symbolic names for these functions to use "alloc time" instead
      of other names.  QAK - 2002/09/13
    * Added "H5D_SPACE_ALLOC_INCR" setting to H5D_SPACE_ALLOC_EARLY and
      H5D_SPACE_ALLOC_LATE for H5Dset_space_time().  This allows chunked
      datasets to be incrementally allocated as in the 1.4.x branch.
      QAK - 2002/08/27
    * Compact dataset is added to the library.  The data will be stored in 
      the header message of dataset layout.  Space allocation time has to be
      EARLY.  No hyperslab is supported for parallel collective write.  There
      is no API changes except activating H5Pset_layout and H5Pget_layout for
      compact dataset.  -SLU, 2002/8/20
    * Added 'closing' parameter to VFL 'flush' callback function and H5FDflush.
      This allows the library to indicate that the file will be closed
      immediately following the call to 'flush' and can be used to avoid actions
      that are duplicated in the VFL 'close' callback function.  QAK - 2002/05/20
    * Added feature to parallel chunk allocation routine to not write fill
      values to chunks allocated if the user has set the "fill time" to never.
      This can improve parallel I/O performance for chunked
      datasets.  QAK - 2002/05/17
    * New functions H5Glink2 and H5Gmove2 were added to allow link and move to
      be in different locations in the same file.  The old functions H5Glink 
      and H5Gmove remain valid.  SLU - 2002/04/26 
    * Fill-value's behaviors for contiguous dataset have been redefined.  
      Basicly, dataset won't allocate space until it's necessary.  Full details
      are available at http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/RFC/Fill_Value, at this moment.
      SLU - 2002/04/11
    * Added new routine "H5Dfill" to fill a selection with a particular value
      in memory.  QAK - 2002/04/09
    * Improved performance of "regular" hyperslab I/O when using MPI-IO and the
      datatype conversion is unneccessary.  QAK - 2002/04/02
    * Improved performance of single hyperslab I/O when datatype conversion is
      unneccessary.  QAK - 2002/04/02
    * Added new "H5Sget_select_type" API function to determine which type of
      selection is defined for a dataspace ("all", "none", "hyperslab" or
      "point"). QAK - 2002/02/07
    * Added support to read/write portions of chunks directly, if they are
      uncompressed and too large to cache.  This should speed up I/O on chunked
      datasets for a few more cases.  QAK - 2002/01/31
    * Added H5Rget_obj_type() API function, which performs the same functionality
      as H5Rget_object_type(), but requires the reference type as a parameter
      in order to correctly handle dataset region references.  Moved
      H5Rget_object_type() to be only compiled into the library when v1.4
      compatibility is enabled.
    * Added a new file access property, file close degree, to control file 
      close behavior.  It has four values, H5F_CLOSE_WEAK, H5F_CLOSE_SEMI,
      H5F_CLOSE_STRONG, and H5F_CLOSE_DEFAULT.  Two correspont functions 
      H5Pset_fclose_degree and H5Pget_fclose_degree are also provided.  Two 
      new functions H5Fget_obj_count and H5Fget_obj_ids are offerted to assist
      this new feature.  For full details, please refer to the reference 
      manual under the description of H5Fcreate, H5Fopen, H5Fclose and the 
      functions mentioned above. 
    * Removed H5P(get|set)_hyper_cache API function, since the property is no
      longer used.
    * Improved performance of non-contiguous hyperslabs (built up with
      several hyperslab selection calls).
    * Improved performance of single, contiguous hyperslabs when reading or
      writing.
    * As part of the transition to using generic properties everywhere, the
      parameter of H5Pcreate changed from H5P_class_t to hid_t, as well
      the return type of H5Pget_class changed from H5P_class_t to hid_t.
      Further changes are still necessary and will be documented here as they
      are made.
    * Improved regular hyperslab I/O by about a factor of 6 or so.
    * Modified the Pablo build procedure to permit building of the instrumented
      library to link either with the Trace libraries as before or with the
      Pablo Performance Caputure Facility.
    * Added new F90 APIs for generic properties, new filters, and
      time/space allocation properties.
    * C++ API:
        - Added two new member functions: Exception::getFuncName() and
          Exception::getCFuncName() to provide the name of the member
          function, where an exception is thrown.
        - IdComponent::operator= becomes a virtual function because
          DataType, DataSpace, and PropList provide their own
          implementation.  The new operator= functions invoke H5Tcopy,
          H5Scopy, and H5Pcopy to make a copy of a datatype, dataspace,
          and property list, respectively.

Parallel Library:
-----------------

Tools:
------
    * When the "-S" option for "simple" output is chosen, h5ls now displays
        modification times of datasets in UTC instead of local time.
        QAK - 2003/06/06
    * h5diff to compare two HDF5 files was added
    * h5import to import ascii and binary data to an HDF5 file was added.
      Old h5import tool in the tools/misc directory was renamed to 
      h5createU8 to reflect its purpose. h5createU8 will be deleted in 
      1.6.1 release. 
    * Two new scripts h5fc and h5c++ were added to compile F90 and C++
      HDF5 applications.

Support for new platforms, languages and compilers.
=======================================
    * Added C++ API support on HPUX11.00.  BMR - 2003/03/19
    * Absoft compiler is supported for Fortran HDF5 Library. 
      When building with Absoft compiler, add -DH5_ABSOFT to
      C compilation flags to get correct names of C functions
      called by Fortran APIs. 


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.0 release
==================================

Library
-------
    * Don't attempt to perform collective I/O on chunked datasets with
      parallel I/O.  QAK - 2003/06/05
    * The library now correctly reuses space when objects are deleted in the
      file.  This should be handled correctly for every situation, except
      datasets with variable-length datatypes are not returning the space they
      use in the global heap currently. QAK - 2003/04/13
    * Fixed error in B-tree deletion routine which could cause groups to be
      corrupted when objects are removed from them.
      QAK - 2003/04/11
    * Fixed error in file space freeing code which could cause metadata to
      fail to be written to the file.
      QAK - 2003/04/11
    * -O caused errors in AIX 5.x platforms.  Removed it from
      --enable-production mode.  AKC - 2003/03/31
    * Corrected memory/resource leaks in per-thread key information when
      thread-safe operation was enabled.  QAK - 2003/02/07
    * Improved error assertion for nil VL strings, making it fails with error
      stack instead of just assertion failure.  SLU - 2002/12/16
    * Added two new API functions: H5Zunregister & H5Zfilter_avail.
      QAK - 2002/11/16
    * Add data shuffle filter(source code H5Zshuffle.c), the combination of the
      shuffling and compression can make data compression better without suffering
      much encoding and decoding CPU time for many application datasets(especially
      for floating point data). This adds a new API function: H5Pset_shuffle.
      KY - 2002/11/13
    * Allow scalar dataspaces to be used for parallel I/O.  QAK - 2002/11/05
    * New functions H5Gget_comment(modification), H5Aget_storage_size, 
      H5Arename.  SLU - 2002/10/29
    * Fixed an assertion of H5S_select_iterate that did not account for scalar
      type that has no dimension sizes.   AKC - 2002/10/15
    * Partially fixed space allocation inefficiencies in the file by
      improving our algorithms for re-using freed space.  QAK - 2002/08/27
    * Fixed data corruption problem which could occur when fill values were
      written to a contiguously stored dataset in parallel.  QAK - 2002/08/27
    * Fixed VL memory leak when data is overwritten.  The heap objects holding
      old data are freed.  If the fill value writting time is set to 
      H5D_FILL_TIME_NEVER, the library prohibits user to create VL type dataset.
      The library free all the heap objects storing VL type if there is nested 
      VL type(a VL type contains another VL type).  SLU - 2002/07/10 
    * Tweaked a few API functions to use 'size_t' instead of 'unsigned' or
      'hsize_t', which may cause errors in some cases.


Configuration
-------------
    * Included the both the examples of fortran and c++ "make check-install"
      testing. This tests the correctness of the h5fc command. AKC - 2003/04/22
    * When using gcc 3.x, we use -std=c99 instead of -ansi for compiling.
      QAK - 2003/04/11
    * IA64 platform has its own configure setting and use Intel Compilers as
      the default compilers (were gcc and pgf90 before.)  This also eliminated
      the segmentation fault in the fortran test.  The missing reference of
      "exit" is fixed too.  AKC - 2003/04/02

Performance
-------------
    * Improved dataset creation time by about 30% (relative to the 1.4.x
      branch).

Tools
-----

    * Added a -force option to h5redeploy.  AKC - 2003/03/04 
    * The VL string bug(data and datatype cannot be shown) in h5dump is fixed.
      -SLU - 2002/11/18
    * Fixed segfault if h5dump was invoked with some options but no file 
      (e.g., h5dump -H). -AKC, 2002/10/15
    * Fixed so that the "-i" flag works correctly with the h5dumper.
    * Fixed segfault when "-v" flag was used with the h5dumper.

    "Platforms Tested" table.



Known Problems
==============

* PGI C++ compiler fails when compiling the C++ library's tests.
  Therefore, we cannot verify that the C++ library built with the PGI C++
  compiler is correct.

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF 5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
  compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
  able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

        warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
  This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.


* The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows. It is not supported
  in the TFLOPS machine.


* The ./dsets tests failed in the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The hdf5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
    - Cray J90 and Cray T90IEEE give errors during testing when displaying
      some floating-point values. These are benign differences due to
      the different precision in the values displayed and h5ls appears to
      be dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

* Before building HDF5 F90 Library from source on Crays 
  replace H5Aff.f90, H5Dff.f90 and H5Pff.f90 files in the fortran/src
  subdirectory in the top level directory with the Cray-specific files
  from the site:

* On some platforms that use Intel compilers to build HDF5 fortran library,
  compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 and fflush2.f90
  complaining about exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error)

  ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/pub/outgoing/hdf5/hdf5-1.6.0/F90_source_for_Crays

* On IA32 and IA64 systems, if you use a compiler other than GCC (such as
  Intel's ecc or icc compilers), you will need to modify the generated
  "libtool" program after configuration is finished. On or around line 104 of
  the libtool file, there are lines which look like:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl=""

  change these lines to this:

      # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
      wl="-Wl,"

  UPDATE: This is now done automatically by the configure script. However, if
  you still experience a problem, you may want to check this line in the
  libtool file and make sure that it has the correct value.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8

- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.4
- Performance Improvements
- Documentation
- Platforms Tested
- Supported Configuration Features
- Known Problems


New Features
============
  o Configuration
  ================
    * Added "unofficial support" for building with a C++ compiler (or at least
      not failing badly when building with a C++ compiler).  QAK - 2003/01/09
    * Added "unofficial support" for AIX 64bits.  See INSTALL for configure
      details. AKC - 2002/08/29
    * Added "--with-dmalloc" flag, to easily enable support for the 'dmalloc'
      debugging malloc implementation. QAK - 2002/07/15

  o Library
  =========
    o General
    --------- 
      * Allow scalar dataspaces to be used for parallel I/O.  QAK - 2002/11/05
      * Added environment variable "HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK", which disables
        the version checking between the header files and the library linked
        into an application if set to '1'.  This should be used with caution,
        mis-matched headers and library binaries can cause _serious_ problems.
        QAK - 2002/10/15
      * Partially fixed space allocation inefficiencies in the file by
        improving our algorithms for re-using freed space.  QAK - 2002/08/27
      * API tracing has been improved. Nested API calls don't screw up the
        output format; function call and return event times can be logged;
        total time spent in each function can be logged.  The following
        HDF5_DEBUG environment variable words affect tracing:
	    trace   -- turn on/off basic tracing
	    ttimes  -- turn on tracing and report event times and
                       time spent in each API function.
        ttop    -- turn on tracing but display only top-level
                       API calls.

    o APIs
    ------
      * Several missing fortran APIs have been added to the library:

        h5get_libversion_f        h5tget_member_index_f  h5dget_storage_size_f 
        h5check_version_f         h5tvlen_create_f       h5dvlen_get_max_len_f
        h5garbage_collect_f                              h5dwrite_vl_f
        h5dont_atexit_f                                  h5dread_vl_f

      Functions h5dvlen_get_max_len_f, h5dwrite_vl_f, and h5dread_vl_f support
      VL Length C APIs functionality for integer, real and string datatypes.
      See HDF5 Reference Manual and HDF5 FORTRAN90 User's Notes for more
      information and for the functions description.

  o Parallel library
  ==================
    * The MPI-posix virtual file driver makes gpfs_fcntl() hints to tell
        the underlying GPFS file system to avoid prefetching byte range
        tokens if USE_GPFS_HINTS is defined when this file is compiled.
        This temporary solution is intended to be removed once the HDF5
        API supports the necessary functionality that makes it possible
        for this sort of thing do be done at a higher software layer.
        RPM - 2002/12/03
    * Added MPI-posix VFL driver.  This VFL driver uses MPI functions to
        coordinate actions, but performs I/O directly with POSIX sec(2)
        (i.e. open/close/read/write/etc.) calls.  This driver should _NOT_
        be used to access files that are not on a parallel filesystem.
        The following API functions were added:
            herr_t H5Pset_fapl_mpiposix(hid_t fapl_id, MPI_Comm comm);
            herr_t H5Pget_fapl_mpiposix(hid_t fapl_id, MPI_Comm *comm/*out*/);
        QAK - 2002/07/15



  o Support for new platforms and languages
  =========================================
    * C++ API now works on the Origin2000 (IRIX6.5.14.)  BMR - 2002/11/14

  
  o Misc.
  =========================================
    HDF5 1.4.5 works with Portland Group Compilers (pgcc, pgf90 and pgCC 
    version 4.0-2) on Linux 2.4 


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.4 Release
==================================
    * H5Fopen without the H5F_ACC_CREAT flag should not succeed in creating
        a new file with the 'core' VFL driver.  QAK - 2003/01/24
    * Corrected metadata caching bug in parallel I/O which could cause hangs
        when chunked datasets were accessed with independent transfer mode.
        QAK - 2003/01/23
    * Allow opening objects with unknown object header messages.
        QAK - 2003/01/21
    * Added improved error assertion for nil VL strings.  It return error
        stack instead of a simple assertion.  SLU - 2002/12/16
    * Fixed h5dump bug(cannot dump data and datatype) for VL string. 
        SLU - 2002/11/18 
    * Fixed error condition where "none" selections were not being handled
        correctly in serial & parallel.  QAK - 2002/10/29
    * Fixed problem where optimized hyperslab routines were incorrectly
        invoked for parallel I/O operations in collective mode.  QAK - 2002/07/22
    * Fixed metadata corruption problem which could occur when many objects
        are created in a file during parallel I/O.  QAK - 2002/07/19
    * Fixed minor problem with configuration when users specified /usr/include
        and /usr/lib for the --with-* options that some compilers can't
        handle. BW - 2003/01/23

Known Problems
==============

    * On Linux 2.4 IA64, Fortran test fails for h5dwrite_vl_f 
      for integer and real base datatypes.

    * When fortran library is built with Intel compilers, compilation
      for fflush1.f90, fflush2.f90 and fortanlib_test.f90 will fail 
      complaining about EXEC function. Comment the call to EXEC subroutine
      in each program, or get a patch for the HDF5 Fortran source code. 

    * Fortran external dataset test fails on Linux 2.4 with pgf90 compiler.

    * On Windows, h5dump may abort printing if a VL string is longer than 4096
      bytes due to a compiler problem.  It'll be fixed in v1.6 release.

    * Datasets or attributes which have a variable-length string datatype are
      not printing correctly with h5dump and h5ls.

    * When a dataset with the variable-length datatype is overwritten, 
      the library can develop memory leaks that cause the file to become 
      unnecessarily large.  This is planned to be fixed in the next release.

    * On the SV1, the h5ls test fails due to a difference between the 
      SV1 printf precision and the printf precision on other platforms.

    * The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some
      platforms (e.g. SP2 parallel, Windows) where the error messages
      directed to "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output
      from stdout.  This is not an error.

    * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for HP-UX
      11.00 platforms.

    * The executables are always dynamic on IRIX64 6.5(64 and n32) and 
      IRIX 6.5 even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * IRIX 6.5 fails to compile if configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * The executables are always dynamic on Solaris 2.7 ans 2.8(64 and n32)
      even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.
    
    * The HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES optimization code in the parallel HDF5 will cause
      a hang in some cases when chunked storage is used.  This is now set to
      be off by default.  One may turn it on by setting the environment 
      variable HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES to a non-zero value such as 1.

    * On OSF1 v5.1 and IA32 h5dumpgentst program that generates test files
      for h5dump, gives segmentation fault.

    * On Windows platforms, C and Fortran tests fail with the debug DLL version
      of the Library if built from all_withf90.zip file.

    * On Cray T3E (sn6606 2.0.6.08 unicosmk CRAY T3E) with Cray Standard C Version 6.6.0.1.3
      compiler optimization causes errors in many HDF5 Library tests. Use -g -h zero flags
      to build HDF5 Library. 

    * On Cray SV1 10.0.1. 0 datatype convertion test fails. Please check HDF FTP site
      if patch is available. We will try to provide one in the nearest future. 

    * For configuration, building and testing with Intel and PGI compilers see
      corresponding section in INSTALL file.

New Features
============
  o Configuration
  ================
    * The H4 to H5 tools have been removed from the main source and placed 
      in a separate package. You can get these tools from the HDF ftp site
      (ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/). The "--with-hdf4" command-line option 
      during configure is no longer valid.  BW - 2002/06/25

  o Library
  =========
    o General
    --------- 
      * Fill-value forward-compatibility with release 1.5 was added.  SLU -
        2002/04/11
      * A new query function H5Tget_member_index has been added for compound
        and enumeration data types.  This function retrieves a member's index 
        by name.  SLU - 2002/04/05
      * Added serial multi-gigabyte file size test.  "test/big -h" shows
        the help page.  AKC - 2002/03/29
 
    o APIs
    ------
      * The F90 subroutines h5dwrite_f, h5dread_f, h5awrite_f, and h5aread_f 
        were overloaded with a "dims" argument of type INTEGER(HSIZE_T) to 
        specify the size of the array.  We recommend using these subroutines 
        with the new type; module subroutines that accept "dims" as an i
        INTEGER array of size 7 will be deprecated in release 1.6.  
        EIP - 2002/05/06
 
    o Performance
    -------------
      * Added internal "small data" aggregation, which can reduce the number of
        actual I/O calls made, improving performance.  QAK - 2002/06/05
      * Improved internal metadata aggregation, which can reduce the number of
        actual I/O calls made, improving performance.  Additionally, this can
        reduce the size of files produced.  QAK - 2002/06/04
      * Improved internal metadata caching, which can reduce the number of
        actual I/O calls made by a substantial amount, improving
        performance.  QAK - 2002/06/03


  o Parallel library
  ==================
    * Fixed bug in parallel I/O routines where a collective I/O which used
      MPI derived types, followed by an independent I/O would cause the library
      to hang.  QAK 2002/06/24
    * Added environment variable flag to control whether creating MPI derived
      types is preferred or not.  This can affect performance, depending on
      which way the MPI-I/O library is optimized.  The default is set to
      prefer MPI derived types for collective raw data transfers; setting the
      HDF5_MPI_PREFER_DERIVED_TYPES environment variable to "0" (i.e.:
      "setenv HDF5_MPI_PREFER_DERIVED_TYPES 0") changes the preference to avoid
      using them whenever possible.  QAK - 2002/06/19
    * Changed MPI I/O routines to avoid creating MPI derived types (and thus
      needing to set the file view) for contiguous selections within datasets.
      This should result in some performance improvement for those types of
      selections.  QAK - 2002/06/18
    * Changed MPI type support for collective I/O to be enabled by default.
      This can be disabled by setting the HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES environment
      variable to the value "0".  QAK - 2002/06/14
    * Allowed chunks in chunked datasets to be cached when parallel file is
      opened for read-only access (bug #709).  QAK - 2002/06/10
    * Changed method for allocating chunked dataset blocks to only allocate
      blocks that don't already exist, instead of attempting to create all the
      blocks all the time.  This improves performance for chunked
      datasets.  QAK - 2002/05/17
    * Allowed the call to MPI_File_sync to be avoided when the file is going to
      immediately be closed, improving performance.  QAK - 2002/05/13
    * Allowed the metadata writes to be shared among all processes, easing the
      burden on process 0.  QAK - 2002/05/10


  o Tools
  =======
    * h5redeploy utility was added. It updates HDF5 compiler tools
      after the HDF5 software has been installed in a new location.


  o Support for new platforms and languages
  =========================================
    * Parallel Fortran Library works now on HP-UX B.11.00 Sys V.
      EIP - 2002/05/06
    * Intel C++ and F90 compilers Version 6.0 are supported on Linux 2.4.
    * Intel C++ compilers Version 6.0 are supported on Windows 2000.

  
  o Misc.
  =========================================
   * zlib has been moved out of the Windows source release. Users should go to
     the ZLIB homepage(http://www.zlib.org) to download the corresponding 
     zlib library.
   * The Windows binary release is built with the old version of the zlib 
     library.  We expect users to use zlib 1.1.4 to build with the source 
     release.  
   * In the Windows-specific install document, we specify how to test backward
     compatibility. However, in this release, we are not testing the backward
     compatibility of HDF5.


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.3 Release
==================================
    * Fixed bug in chunking routines where they were using internal allocation
        free routines, instead of malloc/free, preventing user filters from
        working correctly.  Chunks are now allocated/freed with malloc/free and
        so should the chunks in user filters.  QAK 2002/06/18
    * Fixed bug where regular hyperslab selection could get incorrectly
        transferred when the number of elements in a row did not fit evenly
        into the buffer provided.  QAK 2002/06/12
    * Fixed bug (#499) which allowed an "empty" compound or enumerated datatype
        (one with no members) to be used to create a dataset or to be committed
        to a file.  QAK - 2002/06/11
    * Fixed bug (#777) which allowed a compound datatype to be inserted into
        itself.  QAK - 2002/06/10
    * Fixed bug (#789) where creating 1-D dataset region reference caused the
        library to go into infinite loop.  QAK - 2002/06/10
    * Fixed bug (#699, fix provided by a user) where a scalar dataspace was
        written to the file and then subsequently queried with the
        H5Sget_simple_extent_type function; type was reported as H5S_SIMPLE 
        instead of H5S_SCALAR. EIP - 2002/06/04
    * Clear symbol table node "dirty" flag when flushing symbol tables to
        disk, to reduce I/O calls made & improve performance.  QAK - 2002/06/03
    * Fixed bug where an object's header could get corrupted in certain
        obscure situations when many objects were created in the
        file.  QAK - 2002/05/31
    * Fixed bug where read/write intent in file IDs created with H5Freopen
        was not being kept the same as the original file.  QAK - 2002/05/14
    * Fixed bug where selection offsets were not being used when iterating
        through point and hyperslab selections with
        H5Diterate().  QAK - 2002/04/29
    * Fixed bug where the data for several level deep nested compound &
        variable-length datatypes used for datasets were getting corrupted when
        written to the file.  QAK - 2002/04/17
    * Fixed bug where selection offset was being ignored for certain hyperslab
        selections when optimized I/O was being performed.  QAK - 2002/04/02
    * Fixed limitation in h5dumper with object names which reached over 1024
        characters in length. We can now handle arbitrarily larger sizes for
        object names. BW - 2002/03/29
    * Fixed bug where variable-length string type did not behave as a
        string.  SLU - 2002/03/28
    * Fixed bug in H5Gget_objinfo() which was not setting the 'fileno'
        of the H5G_stat_t struct.  QAK - 2002/03/27
    * Fixed data corruption bug in hyperslab routines when contiguous
        hyperslab that spans entire dimension and is larger than type
        conversion buffer is attempted to be read.  QAK - 2002/03/26


Performance Improvements
========================
    This release of the HDF5 library has been extensively tuned to improve
performance, especially to improve parallel I/O performance.
    Most of the specific information for particular performance improvements
is mentioned in the "New Features" and "Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.3" sections
of this document, but in general, the library should make fewer and larger
I/O requests when accessing a file.  Additionally, improvements to the parallel
I/O portions of the library should have reduced the communications and barriers
used in various internal algorithms, improving the performance of the library.
    However, with the extensive changes to some portions of the library that
were required for these improvements, some errors or unanticipated results may
have been introduced also.  Please report any problems encountered to our
support team at hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu.
    Hopefully these improvements will benefit all HDF5 applications, but if
there are particular I/O patterns that appear to be slower than necessary,
please send e-mail to hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu with a sample program showing the
problem behavior; we will look into the issue to see if it is possible to
address it.

Known Problems
==============

    * Datasets or attributes which have a variable-length string datatype are
      not printing correctly with h5dump and h5ls.

    * When a dataset with the variable-length datatype is overwritten, 
      the library can develop memory leaks that cause the file to become 
      unnecessarily large.  This is planned to be fixed in the next release.

    * On the SV1, the h5ls test fails due to a difference between the 
      SV1 printf precision and the printf precision on other platforms.

    * The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some
      platforms (e.g. SP2 parallel, Windows) where the error messages
      directed to "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output
      from stdout.  This is not an error.

    * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for HP-UX
      11.00 platforms.

    * The executables are always dynamic on IRIX64 6.5(64 and n32) and 
      IRIX 6.5 even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * IRIX 6.5 fails to compile if configured with --enable-static-exec.
    
    * The HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES optimization code in the parallel HDF5 will cause
      a hang in some cases when chunked storage is used.  This is now set to
      be off by default.  One may turn it on by setting the environment 
      variable HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES to a non-zero value such as 1.

    * On IA32 and IA64 systems, if you use a compiler other than GCC (such as
      Intel's ecc or icc compilers), you will need to modify the generated
      "libtool" program after configuration is finished. On or around line 104
      of the libtool file, there are lines which look like:

          # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
          wl=""

      Change these lines to this:

          # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
          wl="-Wl,"

    * To build the Fortran library using Intel compilers, one has to 
          x modify the source code in the fortran/src directory to remove the
            !DEC and !MS compiler directives.
          x The build will fail in the fortran/test directory and then in the
            fortran/examples directory; to proceed, edit the work.pcl files in
            those directories to contain two lines

                    work.pc
                    ../src/work.pc 

    * To build the Fortran library on IA64 use
                   setenv CC "ecc -DIA64"
                   setenv F9X "efc -cl,work.pcl"
            before running configure and see the steps described above.

New Features
============
  o Configuration
  ================
    * Can use just enable-threadsafe if the C compiler has built-in pthreads
      support.

  o Library
  =========
   o General
   --------- 
    * Added a new test to verify the information provided by the configure
      command.
    * Changed internal error handling macros to reduce code size of library by
      about 10%.

   o APIs
   ------
    * Changed prototype for H5Awrite from:
        H5Awrite(hid_t attr_id, hid_t type_id, void *buf)
      to:
        H5Awrite(hid_t attr_id, hid_t type_id, const void *buf)
    * The H5Pset_fapl_split() accepts raw and meta file names similar to the
      syntax of H5Pset_fapl_multi() in addition to what it used to accept.

    C++ API:
    * Added operator= to class PredType
    * Add the overloaded member function Attribute::getName to return
      the attribute name's length as in C API.  Note that the current
      Attribute::getName, that returns "string", is still available.
    * Following the change in the C library, the corresponding C++ API
      is changed from:
        void Attribute::write( const DataType& mem_type, void *buf )
      to:
        void Attribute::write( const DataType& mem_type, const void *buf )

   o Performance
   -------------
    * Added perform programs to test the HDF5 library performance.  Programs
      are installed in directory perform/.
    * Improved performance of byte-swapping during data conversions.
    * Improved performance of single, contiguous hyperslabs when reading or
      writing.
    * Added support to read/write portions of chunks directly, if they are
      uncompressed and too large to cache.  This should speed up I/O on chunked
      datasets for a few more cases.  -QAK, 1/31/02

  o Parallel Library
  ==================
    * Parallel C HDF5 now works on HP-UX platforms, Compaq clusters,
      Linux clusters, Cplants (alpha-linux clusters).

  o Tools
  =======
    * A helper script called ``h5cc'', which helps compilation of HDF5
      programs, is now distributed with HDF5. See the reference manual
      for information on how to use this feature.
    * The H5Dumper can now dump comments associated with groups. -WCW 01-05-02

  o Support for new platforms and languages
  =========================================
    * HDF5 C++ Library is supported on Windows platforms (shared and static)
    * HDF5 F90 shared library is supported on Windows platforms.
    * HDF5 C Library is supported on IA32 and IA64 platforms.



Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.2 Release
==================================

    * Fixed a bug when reading chunked datasets where the edge of the dataset
      would be incorrectly detected and generate an assertion failure.
    * Fixed a bug where reading an entire dataset wasn't being handled
      optimally when the dataset had unlimited dimensions.  Dataset is read
      in a single low-level I/O now, instead of being broken into separate
      pieces internally.
    * Fixed a bug where reading or writing chunked data which needed datatype
      conversion could result in data values getting corrupted.
    * Fixed a bug where appending a point selection to the current selection
      would not actually append the point when there were no points defined
      currently.
    * Fixed a bug where 'or'ing a hyperslab with a 'none' selection would
      fail.  Now adds that hyperslab as the first hyperlab in the selection.
    * Fixed a bug in the 'big' test where quota limits weren't being detected
      properly if they caused close() to fail.
    * Fixed a bug in internal B-tree code where a B-tree was not being copied
      correctly.
    * Fixed an off-by-one error in H5Sselect_valid when hyperslab selections
      which would allow hyperslab selections which overlapped the edge of the
      selection by one element as valid.
    * Fixed the internal macros used to encode & decode file metadata, to avoid
      an unaligned access warning on IA64 machines.
    * Corrected behavior of H5Tinsert to not allow compound datatype fields to
      be inserted past the end of the datatype.
    * Retired the DPSS virtual file driver (--with-gridstorage configure
      option).
    * Fixed bug where variable-length datatypes for attributes was not working
      correctly.
    * Fixed bug where raw data re-allocated from the free-list would sometimes
      overlap with the metadata accumulator and get corrupted. QAK - 1/23/02
    * Fixed bug where a preempted chunk in the chunk data could still be
      used by an internal pointer and cause an assertion failure or core
      dump. QAK - 2/13/02
    * Fixed bug where non-zero fill-value was not being read correctly from
      certain chunked datasets when using an "all" or contiguous hyperslab
      selection.  QAK - 2/14/02


Documentation
=============
    * Documentation was updated for the hdf5-1.4.3 release.
    * A new "HDF5 User's Guide" is under development.  See 
      http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc_dev_snapshot/H5_NewUG/current/.
    * Parallel Tutorial is available at http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/Tutor/

                (2) Using mpt and mpich.
                (3) When configured with static-exec enabled, tests fail 
                    in serial mode.
                (4) No HDF4-related tools.
                (5) Shared libraries are provided only for the C library.
		(6) Exception of (5): DLL is available for C++ API on Windows


Known Problems
==============

    * Datasets or attributes which have a variable-length string datatype are
      not printing correctly with h5dump and h5ls.

    * When a dataset with the variable-legth datatype is overwritten, 
      the library can develop memory leaks that cause the file to become 
      unnecessarily large.  This is planned to be fixed in the next release.

    * On the SV1, the h5ls test fails due to a difference between the 
      SV1 printf precision and the printf precision on other platforms.


    * The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output in some
      platforms (e.g. SP2 parallel, Windows) where the error messages
      directed to "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output
      from stdout.  This is not an error.

    * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for HP-UX
      11.00 platforms.

    * The executables are always dynamic on IRIX64 6.5(64 and n32) and 
      IRIX 6.5 even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * IRIX 6.5 fails to compile if configured with --enable-static-exec.
    
    * The HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES optimization code in the parallel HDF5 will cause
      a hang in some cases when chunked storage is used.  This is now set to
      be off by default.  One may turn it on by setting environment variable
      HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES to a non-zero value such as 1.

    * On IA64 systems one has to use -DIA64 compilation flag to compile
      h4toh5 and h5toh4 utilites. After configuration step manually modify
      Makefile in the tools/h4toh4 and tools/h5toh4 directories to add 
      -DIA64 to the compilation flags.

    * On IA32 ansd IA64 systems, if you use a compiler other than GCC 
      (such as Intel's ecc compiler), you will need to modify the generated
      "libtool" program after configuration is finished. On or around line 102 
      of the libtool file, there are lines which look like:

          # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
          wl=""

      change the lines to this:

          # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
          wl="-Wl,"

New Features
============

    * File sizes greater than 2GB are now supported on Linux systems with
      version 2.4.x or higher kernels.
    * Added a global string variable H5_lib_vers_info_g which holds the
      HDF5 library version information.  This can be used to identify
      an hdf5 library or hdf5 application binary.
      Also added a verification of the consistency between H5_lib_vers_info_g
      and other version information in the source code.
    * Parallel HDF5 now runs on the HP V2500 and HP N4000 machines.
    * F90 API:
        - Added aditional parameter "dims" to the h5dread_f/h5dwrite_f and
          h5aread_f/h5awrite_f subroutines.  This parameter is a 1-D array 
          of size 7 and contains the sizes of the data buffer dimensions. 
          This change enables portability between Windows and UNIX platforms.
          In previous versions of the F90 APIs, the data buffer parameters of 
          the above functions were declared as assumed-shape arrays, which 
          were passed to the C functions by a descriptor.  There is no 
          portable means, however, of passing descriptors from F90 to C, 
          causing portability problems between Windows and UNIX and among
          UNIX platforms.  With this change, the data buffers are assumed-
          size arrays, which can be portably passed to the C functions.
    * F90 static library is available on Windows platforms. 
      See INSTALL_Windows_withF90.txt for details.
    * F90 APIs are available on HPUX 11.00 and 10.20 and IBM SP platforms.
    * H5 <-> GIF convertor has been added. This is available under 
      tools/gifconv. The convertor supports the ability to create animated
      gifs as well.
    * Verified correct operation of library on Solaris 2.8 in both 64-bit and
      32-bit compilation modes.  See INSTALL document for instructions on
      compiling the distribution with 64-bit support.
    * Added support for the Metrowerks Code Warrior compiler for Windows.  
    * For H4->H5 converter utility, added a new option to choose not to convert
      HDF4 specified attributes(reference number, class) into HDF5 attributes.
    * Added support chunking and compression in SDS and image in H4->H5 converter. 
      Currently HDF5 only supports gzip compression, so by default an HDF4 file 
      with any other compression method will be converted into an HDF5 file in 
      gzip compression. 
    * correct the order or reading HDF4 image array in H4->H5 conversion.  
    * Added new parallel hdf5 tests in t_mpi.  The new test checks if the
      filesystem or the MPI-IO can really handle greater than 2GB files.
      If it fails, it prints information message only without failing the
      test.
    * Added a parallel HDF5 example examples/ph5example.c to illustrate
      the basic way of using parallel HDF5.
    * Added a new public macro, H5_VERS_INFO, which is a string holding
      the HDF5 library version information.  This string is also compiled
      into all HDF5 binary code which helps to identify the version information
      of the binary code.  One may use the Unix strings command on the binary
      file and looks for the pattern "HDF5 library version".
    * Added new checking in H5check_version() to verify the five HDF5 version
      information macros (H5_VERS_MAJOR, H5_VERS_MINOR, H5_VERS_RELEASE,
      H5_VERS_SUBRELEASE and H5_VERS_INFO) are consistent.
      
         
Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.1 Release
==================================

    * Fixed bug with non-zero userblock sizes causing raw data to not
      write correctly.
    * Fixed problems with Pablo build and linking with non-standard MPI I/O.
    * Fixed build on Linux systems with --enable-static-exec flag. It now
      works correctly.
    * IMPORTANT: Fixed file metadata corruption bug which could cause 
      metadata data loss in certain situations.
    * The allocation by alignment (H5Pset_alignment) feature code somehow
      got dropped in some 1.3.x version. Re-implemented it with "new and
      improved" algorithm.  It keeps track of "wasted" file-fragment in
      the free-list too.
    * Removed limitation that the data transfer buffer size needed to be
      set for datasets whose dimensions were too large for the 'all' 
      selection code to handle.  Any size dimensioned datasets should be 
      handled correctly now.
    * Changed behavior of H5Tget_member_type to correctly emulate HDF5 v1.2.x
      when --enable-hdf5v1_2 configure flag is enabled.
    * Added --enable-linux-lfs flag to allow more control over whether to 
      enable or disable large file support on Linux.
    * Fixed various bugs releated to SDS dimensional scale conversions in H4->H5 
      converter.
    * Fixed a bug to correctly convert HDF4 objects with fill value into HDF5.
    * Fixed a bug of H5pubconf.h causing repeated definitions if it is included
      more than once.  hdf5.h now includes H5public.h which includes
      H5pubconf.h.  Applications should #include hdf5.h which handles multiple
      inclusion correctly.
    * Fixed H5FDmpio.h to be C++ friendly by making Parallel HDF5 API's to be
      external to C++.
    * Fixed a bug in H5FD_mpio_flush() that might result in negative file seek
      if both MPIO and Split-file drivers are used together.



Documentation
=============

    * The H5T_conv_t and H5T_cdata_t structures are now properly defined
      in the H5Tregister entry in the "H5T" section of the "HDF5 Reference 
      Manual" and described in detail in section 12, "Data Conversions," in 
      the "Datatypes" chapter of the "HDF5 User's Guide."
    * The new tools h52gif and gif2h5 have been added to the "Tools" section
      of the Reference Manual.
    * A "Freespace Management" section has been added to the "Performance" 
      chapter of the User's Guide.
    * Several user-reported bugs have been fixed since Release 1.4.1.
    * The "HDF5 Image and Palette Specification" (in the "HDF5 Application
      Developer's Guide") has been heavily revised.  Based on extensive user 
      feedback and input from visualization software developers, Version 1.2 
      of the image specification is substantially different from prior 
      versions.

Known Problems
==============

    * When a dataset with the variable-legth datatype is overwritten, 
      the library can develop memory leaks that cause the file to become 
      unnecessarily large.  This is planned to be fixed in the next release.

    * On the SV1, the h5ls test fails due to a difference between the 
      SV1 printf precision and the printf precision on other platforms.

    * The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output in some
      platforms (e.g. SP2 parallel, Windows) where the error messages
      directed to "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output
      from stdout.  This is not an error.

    * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for HP-UX
      11.00 platforms.

    * The executables are always dynamic on IRIX64 6.5(64 and n32) and 
      IRIX 6.5 even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * IRIX 6.5 fails to compile if configured with --enable-static-exec.
    
    * For 24-bit image conversion from H4->H5, the current conversion is
      not consistent with HDF5 image specification. 

    * In some cases, and SDS with an UNLIMITED dimension that has not
      been written (current size = 0) is not converted correctly.

    * After "make install" or "make install-doc" one may need to reload
      the source from the tar file before doing another build.

    * The HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES optimization code in the parallel HDF5 will cause
      a hang in some cases when chunked storage is used.  This is now set to
      be off by default.  One may turn it on by setting environment variable
      HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES to a non-zero value such as 1.

New Features
============

   * XML output option for h5dump utility.
  
     A new option --xml to output data in XML format has been added. The
     XML output contains a complete description of the file, marked up in
     XML. 

     The XML conforms to the HDF5 Document Type Definition (DTD), which
     is available at:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/DTDs/HDF5-File.dtd

     The XML output is suitable for use with other tools, including the
     Java Tools:

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.0 Release
==================================

   * h4toh5 utility: conversion of images is fixed

     Earlier releases of the h4toh5 utility produced images that did not
     correctly conform to the HDF5 Image and Palette Specification.

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ImageSpec.html

     Several required HDF5 attributes are omitted, and the dataspace
     is reversed (i.e., the ht. and width of the image dataset is
     incorrectly described.)  For more information, please see:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/H5Image/ImageDetails.htm

   * Fixed bug with contiguous hyperslabs not being detected, causing
     slower I/O than necessary.
   * Fixed bug where non-aligned hyperslab I/O on chunked datasets was
     causing errors during I/O
   * The RCSID string in H5public.h was causing the C++ compiling problem
     because when it was included multiple times, C++ did not like
     multiple definitions of the same static variable. All occurance of
     RCSID definition are removed since we have not used it consistently
     before.

New Features
============
   * The Virtual File Layer, VFL, was added to replace the old file
     drivers. It also provides an API for user defined file drivers.
   * New features added to snapshots. Use 'snapshot help' to see a
     complete list of features.
   * Improved configure to detect if MPIO routines are available when
     parallel mode is requested.
   * Added Thread-Safe support. Phase I implemented. See:

        http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/papers/mthdf/MTHDFpaper.htm

     for more details.
   * Added data sieve buffering to raw data I/O path. This is enabled
     for all VFL drivers except the mpio & core drivers. Setting the
     sieve buffer size is controlled with the new API function,
     H5Pset_sieve_buf_size(), and retrieved with H5Pget_sieve_buf_size().
   * Added new Virtual File Driver, Stream VFD, to send/receive entire
     HDF5 files via socket connections.
   * As parts of VFL, HDF-GASS and HDF-SRB are also added to this
     release. To find out details, please read INSTALL_VFL file. 
   * Increased maximum number of dimensions for a dataset (H5S_MAX_RANK)
     from 31 to 32 to align with HDF4 & netCDF.
   * Added 'query' function to VFL drivers.  Also added 'type' parameter to
     VFL 'read' & 'write' calls, so they are aware of the type of data
     being accessed in the file.  Updated the VFL document also.
   * A new h4toh5 utility, to convert HDF4 files to analogous HDF5 files.
   * Added a new array datatype to the datatypes which can be created.  
     Removed "array fields" from compound datatypes (use an array datatype 
     instead).
   * Parallel HDF5 works correctly with mpich-1.2.1 on Solaris, SGI, Linux.
   * You can now install the HDF5 documentation using the
     ``make install-doc'' command. The documentation is installed in the
     $(prefix)/doc directory where $(prefix) is the prefix specified by
     the (optional) ``--prefix'' flag during configuration.
   * HDF5 can operate correctly in the OpenMP environment in a limited way.
     Check doc/html/TechNotes/openmp-hdf5.html for details.


h4toh5 Utility 
==============
    The h4toh5 utility is a new utility that converts an HDF4 file to an 
    HDF5 file.  For details, see the document, "Mapping HDF4 Objects to 
    HDF5 Objects":
       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/papers/H4-H5MappingGuidelines.pdf

    Known Bugs:

      The h4toh5 utility produces images that do not correctly conform
      to the HDF5 Image and Palette Specification. 

        http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ImageSpec.html

      Several required HDF5 attributes are omitted, and the dataspace 
      is reversed (i.e., the ht. and width of the image dataset is 
      incorrectly described.)  For more information, please see:

        http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/H5Image/ImageDetails.html
 
      This bug has been fixed for the snapshot of hdf5 1.4 release. March 12th,2001

    Known Limitations of the h4toh5 release
    ---------------------------------------------

    1. Error handlings

       h4toh5 utility will print out an error message when an error occurs.

    2. String Datatype

    HDF4 has no 'string' type. String valued data are usually defined as
    an array of 'char' in HDF4. The h4toh5 utility will generally map
    these to HDF5 'String' types rather than array of char, with the
    following additional rules:

       * For the data of an HDF4 SDS, image, and palette, if the data is
         declared 'DFNT_CHAR8' it will be assumed to be integer and will
         be an H5T_INTEGER type.
       * For attributes of any HDF4 object, data of type 'DFNT_CHAR8'
         will be converted to an HDF5 'H5T_STRING' type.
       * For an HDF4 Vdata, it is difficult to determine whether data 
         of type 'DFNT_CHAR8' is intended to be bytes or characters. The
         h4toh5 utility will consider them to be C characters, and will
         convert them to an HDF5 'H5T_STRING' type.


    3. Compression, Chunking and External Storage

    Chunking is supported, but compression and external storage is not.

    An HDF4 object that uses chunking will be converted to an HDF5 file
    with analogous chunked storage.

    An HDF4 object that uses compression will be converted to an
    uncompressed HDF5 object.  

    An HDF4 object that uses external storage will be converted to an
    HDF5 object without external storage.  

    4. Memory Use

    This version of the h4toh5 utility copies data from HDF4 objects
    in a single read followed by a single write to the HDF5 object. For
    large objects, this requires a very large amount of memory, which may
    be extremely slow or fail on some platforms.

    Note that a dataset that has only been partly written will
    be read completely, including uninitialized data, and all the
    data will be written to the HDF5 object.

    5. Platforms

    The h4toh5 utility requires HDF5-1.4.0 and HDF4r1.4

    h4toh5 utility has been tested on all platforms listed below (see 
    section "Platforms Tested") except TFLOPS.

 
F90 Support
===========
    This is the first release of the HDF5 Library with fully integrated 
    F90 API support.  The Fortran Library is created when the 
    --enable-fortran flag is specified during configuration.

    Not all F90 subroutines are implemented. Please refer to the HDF5 
    Reference Manual for more details.
   
    F90 APIs are available for the Solaris 2.6 and 2.7, Linux, DEC UNIX, 
    T3E, SV1 and O2K (64 bit option only) platforms. The Parallel version of 
    the HDF5 F90 Library is supported on the O2K and T3E platforms.

    Changes since the last prototype release (July 2000)
    ----------------------------------------------------
       * h5open_f and h5close_f must be called instead of h5init_types and 
         h5close_types.

       * The following subroutines are no longer available: 

             h5pset_xfer_f
             h5pget_xfer_f
             h5pset_mpi_f
             h5pget_mpi_f
             h5pset_stdio_f
             h5pget_stdio_f
             h5pset_sec2_f
             h5pget_sec2_f
             h5pset_core_f
             h5pget_core_f
             h5pset_family_f
             h5pget_family_f
             
       * The following functions have been added:

             h5pset_fapl_mpio_f
             h5pget_fapl_mpio_f
             h5pset_dxpl_mpio_f
             h5pget_dxpl_mpio_f
        
       * In the previous HDF5 F90 releases, the implementation of object 
         references and dataset region references was not portable. This 
         release introduces a portable implementation, but it also introduces 
         changes to the read/write APIs that handle references.  If object or 
         dataset region references are written or read to/from an HDF5 file, 
         h5dwrite_f and h5dread_f must use the extra parameter, n, for the 
         buffer size:

            h5dwrite(read)_f(dset_id, mem_type_id, buf, n, hdferr, &
                                                       ^^^ 
                             mem_space_id, file_space_id, xfer_prp)

         For other datatypes the APIs were not changed. 
              
             
C++ Support
===========
    This is the first release of the HDF5 Library with fully integrated 
    C++ API support. The HDF5 C++ library is built when the --enable-cxx
    flag is specified during configuration.

    Check the HDF5 Reference Manual for available C++ documentation.

    C++ APIs are available for Solaris 2.6 and 2.7, Linux, and FreeBSD. 


Pablo Support
=============
    This version does not allow proper building of the Pablo-instrumented
    version of the library.  A version supporting the pablo build is
    available on the Pablo Website at 
    www-pablo.cs.uiuc.edu/pub/Pablo.Release.5/HDFLibrary/hdf5_v1.4.tar.gz


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.2.0
==========================

Library
-------
   * The function H5Pset_mpi is renamed as H5Pset_fapl_mpio.
   * Corrected a floating point number conversion error for the Cray J90
     platform. The error did not convert the value 0.0 correctly.
   * Error was fixed which was not allowing dataset region references to
     have their regions retrieved correctly.
   * Corrected a bug that caused non-parallel file drivers to fail in
     the parallel version.
   * Added internal free-lists to reduce memory required by the library
     and H5garbage_collect API function
   * Fixed error in H5Giterate which was not updating the "index"
     parameter correctly.
   * Fixed error in hyperslab iteration which was not walking through the
     correct sequence of array elements if hyperslabs were staggered in a
     certain pattern
   * Fixed several other problems in hyperslab iteration code.
   * Fixed another H5Giterate bug which was causes groups with large
     numbers of objects in them to misbehave when the callback function
     returned non-zero values.
   * Changed return type of H5Aiterate and H5A_operator_t typedef to be
     herr_t, to align them with the dataset and group iterator functions.
   * Changed H5Screate_simple and H5Sset_extent_simple to not allow
     dimensions of size 0 with out the same dimension being unlimited.
   * QAK - 4/19/00 - Improved metadata hashing & caching algorithms to
     avoid many hash flushes and also remove some redundant I/O when
     moving metadata blocks in the file.
   * The "struct(opt)" type conversion function which gets invoked for
     certain compound datatype conversions was fixed for nested compound
     types. This required a small change in the datatype conversion
     function API.
   * Re-wrote lots of the hyperslab code to speed it up quite a bit.
   * Added bounded garbage collection for the free lists when they run
     out of memory and also added H5set_free_list_limits API call to
     allow users to put an upper limit on the amount of memory used for
     free lists.
   * Checked for non-existent or deleted objects when dereferencing one
     with object or region references and disallow dereference.
   * "Time" datatypes (H5T_UNIX_D*) were not being stored and retrieved
     from object headers correctly, fixed now.
   * Fixed H5Dread or H5Dwrite calls with H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE requests
     that may hang because not all processes are transfer the same amount
     of data. (A.K.A. prematured collective return when zero amount data
     requested.) Collective calls that may cause hanging is done via the
     corresponding MPI-IO independent calls.
   * If configure with --enable-debug=all, couple functions would issue
     warning messages to "stderr" that the operation is expensive time-wise.
     This messed up applications (like testings) that did not expect the
     extra output. It is changed so that the warning will be printed only
     if the corresponding Debug key is set.

Configuration
-------------
   * The hdf5.h include file was fixed to allow the HDF5 Library to be
     compiled with other libraries/applications that use GNU autoconf. 
   * Configuration for parallel HDF5 was improved. Configure now attempts
     to link with libmpi.a and/or libmpio.a as the MPI libraries by
     default. It also uses "mpirun" to launch MPI tests by default. It
     tests to link MPIO routines during the configuration stage, rather
     than failing later as before. One can just do "./configure
     --enable-parallel" if the MPI library is in the system library.
   * Added support for pthread library and thread-safe option.
   * The libhdf5.settings file shows the correct machine byte-sex.
   * Added option "--enable-stream-vfd" to configure w/o the Stream VFD.
     For Solaris, added -lsocket to the LIBS list of libraries.

Tools
-----
   * h5dump now accepts both short and long command-line parameters:
         -h, --help          Print a usage message and exit
         -B, --bootblock     Print the content of the boot block
         -H, --header        Print the header only; no data is displayed
         -i, --object-ids    Print the object ids
         -V, --version       Print version number and exit
         -a P, --attribute=P Print the specified attribute
         -d P, --dataset=P   Print the specified dataset
         -g P, --group=P     Print the specified group and all members
         -l P, --soft-link=P Print the value(s) of the specified soft link

     P - is the full path from the root group to the object.
     T - is the name of the data type.
     F - is a filename.
     # - is an integer greater than 1.
   * A change from the old way command line parameters were interpreted
     is that multiple attributes, datasets, groups, soft-links, and
     object-ids cannot be specified with just one flag but you have to
     use a flag with each object. I.e., instead of doing this:

       h5dump -a /attr1 /attr2 foo.h5

     do this:

       h5dump -a /attr1 -a /attr2 foo.h5

     The cases are similar for the other object types.
   * h5dump correctly displays compound datatypes.
   * Corrected an error in h5toh4 which did not convert the 32bits
     int from HDF5 to HDF4 correctly for the T3E platform.
   * h5dump correctly displays the committed copy of predefined types
     correctly.
   * Added an option, -V, to show the version information of h5dump.
   * Fixed a core dumping bug of h5toh4 when executed on platforms like 
     TFLOPS.
   * The test script for h5toh4 used to not able to detect the hdp
     dumper command was not valid.  It now detects and reports the
     failure of hdp execution.
   * Merged the tools with the 1.2.2 branch. Required adding new
     macros, VERSION12 and VERSION13, used in conditional compilation.
     Updated the Windows project files for the tools.            
   * h5dump displays opaque and bitfield data correctly.
   * h5dump and h5ls can browse files created with the Stream VFD
     (eg. "h5ls <hostname>:<port>").
   * h5dump has a new feature "-o <filename>" which outputs the raw data
     of the dataset into ascii text file <filename>.
   * h5toh4 used to converts hdf5 strings type to hdf4 DFNT_INT8 type.
     Corrected to produce hdf4 DFNT_CHAR type instead.
   * h5dump and h5ls displays array data correctly.


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.0-beta2
================================
   * Fixed a bug in the conversion from a little endian double to a big 
     endian float in some special cases.
   * Corrected configuration error which was not including compression 
     support correctly. 
   * Cleaned up lots of warnings.
   * Changed a few h5dump command line switches and added long versions of
     the switches.
   * Changed parameters for H5Tconvert, H5Pset_bufer and H5Pget_buffer from
     size_t to hsize_t
   * Fixed fairly obscure bug in hyperslab I/O which could (in rare cases)
     not copy all the data during a transfer.
   * Removed ragged array code from library.
   * F90 library and module files are installed properly now on all supported 
     platforms.


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.0 Release
==================================

   * Fixed bug with contiguous hyperslabs not being detected, causing
     slower I/O than necessary.
   * Fixed bug where non-aligned hyperslab I/O on chunked datasets was
     causing errors during I/O
   * Implemented XML support in h5dump.


Documentation
=============
   * A new document summarizing the changes in the library leading up to 
     the current release has been added: 
           HDF5 Software Changes from Release to Release
     This document is in the Application Developer's Guide and is of 
     particular interest to developers who must keep an application 
     synchronized with the library.
   * The documentation for the Fortran90 and C++ APIs is linked to the
     opening page of the Reference Manual.  Fortran90 functions are 
     individually referenced from the corresponding C functions through-
     out the Reference Manual.
   * User's Guide and Reference Manual were updated to reflect changed 
     function syntax and to fix reported bugs. 
   * Functions that are new at this release were added to the Reference 
     Manual.  
   * Functions that have been removed from the library were removed from 
     the User's Guide and the Reference Manual.
   * PostScript and PDF versions of the Release 1.4 document set are 
     not available at the time of Release 1.4.0.

    Footnotes:  (1) Using mpich.
                (2) Using mpt and mpich.
                (3) When configured with static-exec enabled, tests fail 
                    in serial mode.
                (4) No HDF4-related tools.


Known Problems
==============
   * The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing.  If another 
     application is already using that port address, the test will hang 
     indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command.  To try the 
     test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not 
     being used in the host.

   * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
     platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
     libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

     The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
     on Linux platforms using the gcc-2.95.2 compiler.
   
     The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
     on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode.  The parallel mode works fine
     with this option.

     The compilation fails if configured with --enable-static-exec on IRIX 6.5.

     The executable files in hdf5/bin are dynamic-linked for IRIX64 6.5(64 and
     n32 modes) and IRIX 6.5, even though they are compiled with static library.
  
     It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
     during configuration.

   * testhdf5 got bus error with configuration options --prefix and --with-hdf4
     on IRIX 6.5.

   * With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF 5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
     compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
     able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

           warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
     This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.

   * SunOS 5.6 with C WorkShop Compilers 4.2:  Hyperslab selections will 
     fail if library is compiled using optimization of any level.

   * When building hdf5 tools and applications on windows platform, a linking
     warning: defaultlib "LIBC" conflicts with use of other libs will appear
     on debug version when running VC++6.0. This warning doesn't affect building
     and testing hdf5 applications. We will continue investigating this.

   * h5toh4 converter fails two cases(tstr.h5 and tmany.h5) for release dll 
     version on windows 2000 and NT.  The reason is possibly due to Windows NT 
     DLL convention on freeing memory. It seems that memory cannot be freed
     across library or DLL. It is still under investigation.

   * HDF-GASS testings and testhdf5 in the test directory will get bus error if
     the configured with --with-gass.

   * HDF-SRB testing got segmentation error on Solaris 2.7.
    
   * The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows.
     It is not supported in the TFLOPS machine.

   * Shared library option is broken for IBM SP and some Origin 2000 platforms.
     One needs to run ./configure with '--disable-shared --enable-static'.

   * The ./dsets tests failed in the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
     dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The hdf5 library still works
     correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
     compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
     program to fail.

   * Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
       - Solaris x86 2.5.1, Cray T3E and Cray J90 give errors during testing
         when displaying object references in certain files.  These are benign 
         differences due to the difference in sizes of the objects created on
         those platforms.  h5ls appears to be dumping object references
         correctly.
       - Cray J90 give errors during testing when displaying
         some floating-point values.  These are benign differences due to the
         different precision in the values displayed and h5ls appears to be
         dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

   * Before building HDF5 F90 Library from source on Crays (T3E and SV1) 
     replace H5Aff.f90, H5Dff.f90 and H5Pff.f90 files in the fortran/src 
     subdirectory in the top level directory with the Cray-specific files from 
     the ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/hdf5-1.4.0/src/crayf90/  directory.

   * The h4toh5 utility produces images that do not correctly conform
     to the HDF5 Image and Palette Specification. 

         http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ImageSpec.html

     Several required HDF5 attributes are omitted, and the dataspace 
     is reversed (i.e., the ht. and width of the image dataset is 
     incorrectly described.)  For more information, please see:

CONTENTS

- Features Added since HDF5-1.2.1 
- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.2.1
- Known Problems
- Platforms Tested


Features Added since HDF5-1.2.1
===============================
   * Added internal free-lists to reduce memory required by the library and
     H5garbage_collect API function.
   * h5dump displays opaque and bitfield types.
   * New features added to snapshots.  Use 'snapshot help' to see a
     complete list of features.
   * Improved configure to detect if MPIO routines are available when
     parallel mode is requested.

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.2.1
==========================
   * h5dump correctly displays compound datatypes, including simple and
     nested compound types.
   * h5dump correctly displays the committed copy of predefined types.
   * Corrected an error in h5toh4 which did not convert the 32-bit
     int from HDF5 to HDF4 correctly for the T3E platform.
   * Corrected a floating point number conversion error for the
     Cray J90 platform.  The error did not convert the value 0.0
     correctly.
   * Fixed error in H5Giterate which was not updating the "index" parameter
     correctly.
   * Fixed error in hyperslab iteration which was not walking through the
     correct sequence of array elements if hyperslabs were staggered in a
     certain pattern.
   * Fixed several other problems in hyperslab iteration code.
   * Fixed another H5Giterate bug which caused groups with large numbers
     of objects in them to misbehave when the callback function returned
     non-zero values.
   * Changed return type of H5Aiterate and H5A_operator_t typedef to be
     herr_t, to align them with the dataset and group iterator functions.
   * Changed H5Screate_simple and H5Sset_extent_simple to not allow dimensions
     of size 0 without the same dimension being unlimited.
   * Improved metadata hashing & caching algorithms to avoid
     many hash flushes and also removed some redundant I/O when moving metadata
     blocks in the file.
   * The libhdf5.settings file shows the correct machine byte-sex.
   * The "struct(opt)" type conversion function which gets invoked for
     certain compound datatype conversions was fixed for nested compound
     types. This required a small change in the datatype conversion
     function API.

Known Problems
==============

o SunOS 5.6 with C WorkShop Compilers 4.2:  hyperslab selections will 
  fail if library is compiled using optimization of any level.
o TFLOPS: dsets test fails if compiled with optimization turned on.
o J90: tools fail to dispay data for the datasets with a compound datatype.

%%%%1.2.1%%%%   Release Information for hdf5-1.2.1

6.  Release Information for hdf5-1.2.1
================================================================


Bug fixes since HDF5-1.2.0
==========================

Configuration
-------------

   * The hdf5.h include file was fixed to allow the HDF5 Library to be compiled
     with other libraries/applications that use GNU autoconf. 
   * Configuration for parallel HDF5 was improved. Configure now attempts to
     link with libmpi.a and/or libmpio.a as the MPI libraries by default.
     It also uses "mpirun" to launch MPI tests by default.  It tests to
     link MPIO routines during the configuration stage, rather than failing
     later as before.  One can just do "./configure --enable-parallel"
     if the MPI library is in the system library.

Library
-------

   * Error was fixed which was not allowing dataset region references to have
     their regions retrieved correctly.
   * Added internal free-lists to reduce memory required by the library and
     H5garbage_collect API function
   * Fixed error in H5Giterate which was not updating the "index" parameter
     correctly.
   * Fixed error in hyperslab iteration which was not walking through the
     correct sequence of array elements if hyperslabs were staggered in a
     certain pattern
   * Fixed several other problems in hyperslab iteration code.

Tests
------

   * Added additional tests for group and attribute iteration.
   * Added additional test for staggered hyperslab iteration.
   * Added additional test for random 5-D hyperslab selection.

Tools
------

   * Added an option, -V, to show the version information of h5dump.
   * Fixed a core dumping bug of h5toh4 when executed on platforms like 
     TFLOPS.
   * The test script for h5toh4 used to not able to detect the hdp
     dumper command was not valid.  It now detects and reports the
     failure of hdp execution.

Documentation
-------------

   * User's Guide and Reference Manual were updated. 
     See doc/html/PSandPDF/index.html for more details.

   --------------

* NT alpha 4.0
  Dumper utiliy h5dump fails if linked with DLL.

* SunOS 5.6 with C WorkShop Compilers 4.2
  Hyperslab selections will fail if library is compiled using optimization
  of any level.

 
C. Changes Since Version 1.0.1
   ---------------------------

1. Documentation
   -------------

* More examples

* Updated user guide, reference manual, and format specification.

* Self-contained documentation for installations isolated from the
  Internet.

* HDF5 Tutorial was added to the documentation  

2. Configuration
   -------------

* Better detection and support for MPI-IO.

* Recognition of compilers with known code generation problems.

* Support for various compilers on a single architecture (e.g., the
  native compiler and the GNU compilers).

* Ability to build from read-only media and with different compilers
  and/or options concurrently.

* Added a libhdf5.settings file which summarizes the configuration
  information and is installed along with the library.

* Builds a shared library on most systems that support it.

* Support for Cray T3E, J90 and Windows/NT.

3. Debugging
   ---------

* Improved control and redirection of debugging and tracing messages.

4. Datatypes
   ---------

* Optimizations to compound datatype conversions and I/O operations.

* Added nearly 100 optimized conversion functions for native datatypes 
  including support for non-aligned data.

* Added support for bitfield, opaque, and enumeration types.

* Added distinctions between signed and unsigned char types to the
  list of predefined native hdf5 datatypes.

* Added HDF5 type definitions for C9x types like int32_t.

* Application-defined type conversion functions can handle non-packed
  data.

* Changed the H5Tunregister() function to use wildcards when matching
  conversion functions.  H5Tregister_hard() and H5Tregister_soft()
  were combined into H5Tregister().

* Support for variable-length datatypes (arrays of varying length per
  dataset element). Variable length strings currently supported only
  as variable length arrays of 1-byte integers.

5. Dataspaces
   ----------

* New query functions for selections.

* I/O operations bypass the stripmining loop and go directly to
  storage for certain contiguous selections in the absense of type
  conversions.  In other cases the stripmining buffers are used more
  effectively.

* Reduced the number of I/O requests under certain circumstances,
  improving performance on systems with high I/O latency.

6. Persistent Pointers
   -------------------

* Object (serial and parallel) and dataset region (serial only)
  references are implemented.

7. Parallel Support
   ----------------

* Improved parallel I/O performance.

* Supported new platforms: Cray T3E, Linux, DEC Cluster.

* Use vendor supported version of MPIO on SGI O2K and Cray platforms.

* Improved the algorithm that translates an HDF5 hyperslab selection
  into an MPI type for better collective I/O performance.

%%%%1.0.1%%%%   Release Information for hdf5-1.0.1
         
4.  Changes from Release 1.0.0 to Release 1.0.1
=====================================================================

* [Improvement]: configure sets up the Makefile in the parallel tests
  suit (testpar/) correctly.

* [Bug-Fix]: Configure failed for all IRIX versions other than 6.3.
  It now configures correctly for all IRIX 6.x version.

* Released Parallel HDF5 

     Supported Features:
     ------------------

     HDF5 files are accessed according to the communicator and INFO
     object defined in the property list set by H5Pset_mpi.

     Independent read and write accesses to fixed and extendable dimension
     datasets.

     Collective read and write accesses to fixed dimension datasets.

     Supported Platforms:
     -------------------

     Intel Red
     IBM SP2
     SGI Origin 2000

     Changes In This Release: 
     -----------------------

   o Support of Access to Extendable Dimension Datasets.
     Extendable dimension datasets must use chunked storage methods.
     A new function, H5Dextend, is created to extend the current
     dimensions of a dataset.  The current release requires the
     MPI application must make a collective call to extend the
     dimensions of an extendable dataset before writing to the
     newly extended area.  (The serial does not require the
     call of H5Dextend.  The dimensions of an extendable
     dataset is increased when data is written to beyond the
     current dimensions but within the maximum dimensions.)
     The required collective call of H5Dextend may be relaxed
     in future release.

     This release only support independent read and write accesses
     to extendable datasets.  Collective accesses to extendable
     datasets will be implemented in future releases.

   o Collective access to fixed dimension datasets.
     Collective access to a dataset can be specified in the transfer
     property list argument in H5Dread and H5Dwrite.  The current
     release supports collective access to fixed dimension datasets.
     Collective access to extendable datasets will be implemented in
     future releases.

   o HDF5 files are opened according to Communicator and INFO object.
     H5Dopen now records the communicator and INFO setup by H5Pset_mmpi
     and pass them to the corresponding MPIO open file calls for
     processing.

   o This release has been tested on IBM SP2, Intel Red and SGI Origin 2000
     systems.  It uses the ROMIO version of MPIO interface for parallel
     I/O supports.



%%%%1.0.0%%%%   Release Information for hdf5-1.0.0

3.  Changes from the Beta 1.0.0 Release to Release 1.0.0
====================================================================

* Added fill values for datasets.  For contiguous datasets fill value
  performance may be quite poor since the fill value is written to the 
  entire dataset when the dataset is created.  This will be remedied
  in a future version.  Chunked datasets using fill values do not
  incur any additional overhead. See H5Pset_fill_value().

* Multiple hdf5 files can be "mounted" on one another to create a
  larger virtual file. See H5Fmount().

* Object names can be removed or changed but objects are never
  actually removed from the file yet. See H5Gunlink() and H5Gmove().

* Added a tuning mechanism for B-trees to insure that sequential
  writes to chunked datasets use less overhead.  See H5Pset_btree_ratios().

* Various optimizations and bug fixes.



%%%%1.0.0 Beta%%%%   Release Information for hdf5-1.0.0 Beta

2. Changes from the Second Alpha 1.0.0 Release to the Beta 1.0.0 Release
=========================================================================

* Strided hyperslab selections in dataspaces now working.

* The compression API has been replaced with a more general filter
  API.  See doc/html/Filters.html for details.

* Alpha-quality 2d ragged arrays are implemented as a layer built on
  top of other hdf5 objects.  The API and storage format will almost
  certainly change.

* More debugging support including API tracing.  See Debugging.html.

* C and Fortran style 8-bit fixed-length character string types are
  supported with space or null padding or null termination and
  translations between them.

* Added function H5Fflush() to write all cached data immediately to
  the file.

* Datasets maintain a modification time which can be retrieved with
  H5Gstat().

* The h5ls tool can display much more information, including all the
  values of a dataset.



%%%%1.0.0 Alpha 2%%%%   Release Information for hdf5-1.0.0 Alpha 2

1.  Changes from the First Alpha 1.0.0 Release to 
     the Second Alpha 1.0.0 Release
=====================================================================

* Two of the packages have been renamed.  The data space API has been
  renamed from `H5P' to `H5S' and the property list (template) API has 
  been renamed from `H5C' to `H5P'.

* The new attribute API `H5A' has been added.  An attribute is a small 
  dataset which can be attached to some other object (for instance, a
  4x4 transformation matrix attached to a 3-dimensional dataset, or an 
  English abstract attached to a group).

* The error handling API `H5E' has been completed.  By default, when an
  API function returns failure an error stack is displayed on the
  standard error stream.  The H5Eset_auto() controls the automatic
  printing and H5E_BEGIN_TRY/H5E_END_TRY macros can temporarily
  disable the automatic error printing.

* Support for large files and datasets (>2GB) has been added.  There
  is an html document that describes how it works.  Some of the types
  for function arguments have changed to support this: all arguments
  pertaining to sizes of memory objects are `size_t' and all arguments 
  pertaining to file sizes are `hsize_t'.

* More data type conversions have been added although none of them are
  fine tuned for performance.  There are new converters from integer
  to integer and float to float, but not between integers and floating
  points.  A bug has been fixed in the converter between compound
  types.

* The numbered types have been removed from the API: int8, uint8,
  int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, float32, and float64.
  Use standard C types instead.  Similarly, the numbered types were
  removed from the H5T_NATIVE_* architecture; use unnumbered types
  which correspond to the standard C types like H5T_NATIVE_INT.

* More debugging support was added.  If tracing is enabled at
  configuration time (the default) and the HDF5_TRACE environment
  variable is set to a file descriptor then all API calls will emit
  the function name, argument names and values, and return value on
  that file number.  There is an html document that describes this.
  If appropriate debugging options are enabled at configuration time,
  some packages will display performance information on stderr.

* Data types can be stored in the file as independent objects and
  multiple datasets can share a data type.

* The raw data I/O stream has been implemented and the application can 
  control meta and raw data caches, so I/O performance should be
  improved from the first alpha release.

* Group and attribute query functions have been implemented so it is
  now possible to find out the contents of a file with no prior
  knowledge.

* External raw data storage allows datasets to be written by other
  applications or I/O libraries and described and accessed through
  HDF5.

* Hard and soft (symbolic) links are implemented which allow groups to 
  share objects. Dangling and recursive symbolic links are supported.

* User-defined data compression is implemented although we may
  generalize the interface to allow arbitrary user-defined filters
  which can be used for compression, checksums, encryption,
  performance monitoring, etc.  The publicly-available `deflate'
  method is predefined if the GNU libz.a can be found at configuration 
  time.

* The configuration scripts have been modified to make it easier to
  build debugging vs. production versions of the library.

* The library automatically checks that the application was compiled
  with the correct version of header files.


		    Parallel HDF5 Changes

* Parallel support for fixed dimension datasets with contiguous or
  chunked storages.  Also, support unlimited dimension datasets which
  must use chunk storage.  No parallel support for compressed datasets.

* Collective data transfer for H5Dread/H5Dwrite.  Collective access
  support for datasets with contiguous storage only, thus only fixed
  dimension datasets for now.

* H5Pset_mpi and H5Pget_mpi no longer have the access_mode
  argument.  It is taken over by the data-transfer property list
  of H5Dread/H5Dwrite.

* New functions H5Pset_xfer and H5Pget_xfer to handle the
  specification of independent or collective data transfer_mode
  in the dataset transfer properties list.  The properties
  list can be used to specify data transfer mode in the H5Dwrite
  and H5Dread function calls.

* Added parallel support for datasets with chunked storage layout.
  When a dataset is extend in a PHDF5 file, all processes that open
  the file must collectively call H5Dextend with identical new dimension
  sizes.

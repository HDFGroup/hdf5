<H2><A NAME="Intro-WhatIs">1. What Is HDF5?</A></H2>
<FONT FACE="Times"><P>HDF5 is a new, experimental version of HDF that is designed to address some of the limitations of the current version of HDF (HDF4.x) and to address current and anticipated requirements of modern systems and applications. 
<P>We urge you to look at this new version of HDF and give us feedback on what you like or do not like about it, and what features you would like to see added to it.
<a name="Intro-Why">
<P><B>Why HDF5?</B></a>
The development of HDF5 is motivated by a number of limitations in the current HDF format, as well as limitations in the library. Some of these limitations are:

<UL>
</FONT><LI>A single file cannot store more than 20,000 complex objects, and a single file cannot be larger than 2 gigabytes.
<LI>The data models are less consistent than they should be, there are more object types than necessary, and datatypes are too restricted. 
<LI>The library source is old and overly complex, does not support parallel I/O effectively, and is difficult to use in threaded applications.</UL>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>HDF5 includes the following improvements.

<UL>
</FONT><LI>A new file format designed to address some of the deficiencies of HDF4.x, particularly the need to store larger files and more objects per file. 
<LI>A simpler, more comprehensive data model that includes only two basic structures: a multidimensional array of record structures, and a grouping structure. 
<LI>A simpler, better-engineered library and API, with improved support for parallel I/O, threads, and other requirements imposed by modern systems and applications.</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Intro-Limits">Limitations of the Current Release</A></H3>
<FONT FACE="Times"><P>This release includes the basic functionality that was planned for the HDF5 library. However, the library does not implement all of the features detailed in the format and API specifications. Here is a listing of some of the limitations of the current release: 

<UL>
</FONT><LI>Data compression is supported, though only GZIP is implemented.  GZIP, or GNU Zip, is a compression function from the GNU Project.
<LI>Some functions for manipulating dataspaces have not been implemented.
<FONT FACE="Times"><LI>Some number types, including user-defined number types are not supported. 
</FONT>
<LI>The library is not currently thread aware although we have planned for that possibility and intend eventually to implement it.
<li>The only reference supported in this release is an object reference.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Intro-Changes">Changes in the Current Release</A></H3>
<P>A detailed listing of changes in HDF5 since the last release (HDF5 1.0 Beta) can be found in the file <CODE>hdf5/RELEASE </CODE>in the code installation.  Important changes include:

<UL>
<li>An object reference has been implemented.
<li>Union selection (unions of hyperslabs) has been implemented.
<li>Fill values have been implemented.
</UL>

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="Intro-FileOrg">2. HDF5 File Organization and Data Model</A></H2>
<FONT FACE="Times"><P>HDF5 files are organized in a hierarchical structure, with two primary structures: <I>groups</I> and <I>datasets</I>.

<UL>
</FONT><I><LI>HDF5 group: </I>a grouping structure containing instances of zero or more groups or datasets, together with supporting metadata.
<I><LI>HDF5 dataset:</I> a multidimensional array of data elements, together with supporting metadata. </UL>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Working with groups and group members is similar in many ways to working with directories and files in UNIX. As with UNIX directories and files, objects in an HDF5 file are often described by giving their full (or absolute) path names. 
</FONT><CODE><DL>
<DD>/</CODE> signifies the root group. </DD>
<CODE><DD>/foo</CODE> signifies a member of the root group called <CODE>foo</CODE>.</DD>
<CODE><DD>/foo/zoo</CODE> signifies a member of the group <CODE>foo</CODE>, which in turn is a member of the root group.</DD>
</DL>
<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Any HDF5 group or dataset may have an associated <I>attribute list.</I> An HDF5 <I>attribute</I> is a user-defined HDF5 structure that provides extra information about an HDF5 object. Attributes are described in more detail below. 
</FONT><H3><A NAME="Intro-OGroups">HDF5 Groups</A></H3>
<FONT FACE="Times"><P>An<I> HDF5 group</I> is a structure containing zero or more HDF5 objects. A group has two parts:

<UL>
</FONT><LI>A <I>group header</I>, which contains a group name and a list of group attributes. 
<LI>A group symbol table, which is a list of the HDF5 objects that belong to the group.</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Intro-ODatasets">HDF5 Datasets</A></H3>
<FONT FACE="Times"><P>A dataset is stored in a file in two parts: a header and a data array. 
<P>The header contains information that is needed to interpret the array portion of the dataset, as well as metadata (or pointers to metadata) that describes or annotates the dataset. Header information includes the name of the object, its dimensionality, its number-type, information about how the data itself is stored on disk, and other information used by the library to speed up access to the dataset or maintain the file's integrity.
<P>There are four essential classes of information in any header: <I>name</I>, <I>datatype</I>, <I>dataspace</I>, and <I>storage layout</I>:
</FONT><B><DFN><P>Name.</B></DFN><FONT FACE="Times"> A dataset <I>name</I> is a sequence of alphanumeric ASCII characters.
</FONT><B><DFN><P>Datatype.</B></DFN><FONT FACE="Times"> HDF5 allows one to define many different kinds of datatypes. There are two categories of datatypes: <I>atomic</I> datatypes and <I>compound</I> datatypes. 
Atomic datatypes can also be system-specific, or <I><CODE>NATIVE</CODE></I>, and all datatypes can be <I>named</I>:
<ul>
<li><em>Atomic</em> datatypes are those that are not decomposed at the datatype interface level, such as integers and floats.
<li><I><CODE>NATIVE</CODE></I> datatypes are system-specific instances of atomic datatypes. 
<li>Compound datatypes are made up of atomic datatypes.
<li><em>Named</em> datatypes are either atomic or compound datatypes that have been specifically designated to be shared across datasets.
</ul>
<I><P>Atomic datatypes</I> include integers and floating-point numbers. Each atomic type belongs to a particular class and has several properties: size, order, precision, and offset. In this introduction, we consider only a few of these properties.
<P>Atomic classes include integer, float, date and time, string, bit field, and opaque. <I>(Note: Only integer, float and string  classes are available in the current implementation.)
</I><P>Properties of integer types include size, order (endian-ness), and signed-ness (signed/unsigned).
<P>Properties of float types include the size and location of the exponent and mantissa, and the location of the sign bit.
<P>The datatypes that are supported in the current implementation are: 

<UL>
</FONT><LI>Integer datatypes: 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit integers in both little and big-endian format. 
<LI>Floating-point numbers: IEEE 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point numbers in both little and big-endian format.
<li>References.
<LI>Strings.</UL>

<p>
<em><code>NATIVE</code> datatypes.</em>  Although it is possible to describe nearly any kind of atomic data type, most applications will use predefined datatypes that are supported by their compiler.  In HDF5 these are called <i>native</i> datatypes. <CODE>NATIVE</CODE> datatypes are C-like datatypes that are generally supported by the hardware of the machine on which the library was compiled. In order to be portable, applications should almost always use the <CODE>NATIVE </CODE>designation to describe data values in memory.
<P>The <CODE>NATIVE</CODE> architecture has base names which do not follow the same rules as the others.  Instead, native type names are similar to the C type names.  The following figure shows several examples.

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>A <I>compound datatype</I> is one in which a collection of simple datatypes are represented as a single unit, similar to a <I>struct</I> in C. The parts of a compound datatype are called <I>members.</I> The members of a compound datatype may be of any datatype, including another compound datatype. It is possible to read members from a compound type without reading the whole type.
<p>
<ta/FONT><I><P>Named datatypes.</I>  Normally each dataset has its own datatype, but sometimes we may want to share a datatype among several datasets.  This can be done using a <I>named </I>datatype. A named data type is stored in the file independently of any dataset, and referenced by all datasets that have that datatype.  Named datatypes may have an associated attributes list.  
See <A HREF="Datatypes.html"><I>Datatypes</I></A></font><FONT FACE="Times"> in the<I> HDF User&#146s Guide</I> for further information.
<B><DFN><P>Dataspace.</B> </DFN>A dataset <I>dataspace </I>describes the dimensionality of the dataset. The dimensions of a dataset can be fixed (unchanging), or they may be <I>unlimited</I>, which means that they are extendible (i.e. they can grow larger). 
<P>Properties of a dataspace consist of the <I>rank </I>(number of dimensions) of the data array, the <I>actual sizes of the dimensions</I> of the array, and the <I>maximum sizes of the dimensions </I>of the array. For a fixed-dimension dataset, the actual size is the same as the maximum size of a dimension. When a dimension is unlimited, the maximum size is set to the </FONT>value <CODE>H5P_UNLIMITED</CODE>.<FONT FACE="Times"> (An example below shows how to create extendible datasets.)
<P>A dataspace can also describe portions of a dataset, making it possible to do partial I/O operations on  <I>selections</I>.  <I>Selection</I> is supported by the dataspace interface (H5S). Given an n-dimensional dataset, there are currently four ways to do partial selection: 
<OL>

</FONT><LI>Select a logically contiguous n-dimensional hyperslab.  
<LI>Select a non-contiguous hyperslab consisting of elements or blocks of elements (hyperslabs) that are equally spaced.
<li>Select a union of hyperslabs.
<LI>Select a list of independent points. </OL>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Since I/O operations have two end-points, the raw data transfer functions require two dataspace arguments: one describes the application memory dataspace or subset thereof, and the other describes the file dataspace or subset thereof.
<P>See <A HREF="Dataspaces.html"><I>Dataspaces</I></A></font><FONT FACE="Times"> in the<I> HDF User&#146s Guide</I> for further information.
</FONT><B><DFN><P>Storage layout.</B></DFN><FONT FACE="Times"> The HDF5 format makes it possible to store data in a variety of ways. The default storage layout format is <I>contiguous</I>, meaning that data is stored in the same linear way that it is organized in memory. Two other storage layout formats are currently defined for HDF5: <I>compact, </I>and<I> chunked. </I>In the future, other storage layouts may be added.<I> 
<P>Compact</I> storage is used when the amount of data is small and can be stored directly in the object header. <I>(Note: Compact storage is not supported in this release.)</I> 
<I><P>Chunked</I> storage involves dividing the dataset into equal-sized "chunks" that are stored separately. Chunking has three important benefits. 
<OL>

<LI>It makes it possible to achieve good performance when accessing subsets of the datasets, even when the subset to be chosen is orthogonal to the normal storage order of the dataset. 
<LI>It makes it possible to compress large datasets and still achieve good performance when accessing subsets of the dataset. 
<LI>It makes it possible efficiently to extend the dimensions of a dataset in any direction.</OL>

We particularly encourage you to read <A HREF="Chunking.html"><I>Dataset Chunking Issues</I></A> since the issue is complex and beyond the scope of this document.
</FONT><H3><A NAME="Intro-OAttributes">HDF5 Attributes</A></H3>
<I>Attributes </I>are small named datasets that are attached to primary datasets, groups, or named datatypes.  Attributes can be used to describe the nature and/or the intended usage of a dataset or group. An attribute has two parts: (1) a <I>name</I> and (2) a <I>value</I>.  The value part contains one or more data entries of the same data type. 
<FONT FACE="Times"><P>The Attribute API (H5A) is used to read or write attribute information. When accessing attributes, they can be identified by name or by an <I>index value</I>.  The use of an index value makes it possible to iterate through all of the attributes associated with a given object.
<P>The HDF5 format and I/O library are designed with the assumption that attributes are small datasets. They are always stored in the object header of the object they are attached to.  Because of this, large datasets should not be stored as attributes. How large is "large" is not defined by the library and is up to the user's interpretation. (Large datasets with metadata can be stored as supplemental datasets in a group with the primary dataset.)

<P>Recall that datatypes and dimensionality (dataspace) are independent objects, which are created separately from any dataset that they might be attached to. Because of this the creation of a dataset requires, at a minimum, separate definitions of datatype, dimensionality, and dataset. Hence, to create a dataset the following steps need to be taken:

<FONT FACE="Times"><LI VALUE=1>Create and initialize a dataspace for the dataset to be written.
<LI>Define the datatype for the dataset to be written. 
<LI>Create and initialize the dataset itself.</OL>

For instance, we often need to know about the datatype associated with a dataset, as well dataspace information (e.g. rank and dimensions). There are several "get" routines for obtaining this information.  The following code segment illustrates how we would get this kind of information: 
</FONT><CODE><PRE>/*

</CODE><H4><A NAME="Intro-PMRdWrPortion">Reading and writing a portion of a dataset</A></H4>
<P>In the previous discussion, we describe how to access an entire dataset with one write (or read) operation. HDF5 also supports access to portions (or selections) of a dataset in one read/write operation. Currently selections are limited to hyperslabs, their unions, and the lists of independent points. Both types of selection will be discussed in the following sections. Several sample cases of selection reading/writing are shown on the following figure.

</B><P>In example (a) a single hyperslab is read from the midst of a two-dimensional array in a file and stored in the corner of a smaller two-dimensional array in memory.  In (b) a regular series of blocks is read from a two-dimensional array in the file and stored as a contiguous sequence of values at a certain offset in a one-dimensional array in memory.  In (c) a sequence of points with no regular pattern is read from a two-dimensional array in a file and stored as a sequence of points with no regular pattern in a three-dimensional array in memory. 
In (d) a union of hyperslabs in the file dataspace is read and 
the data is stored in another union of hyperslabs in the memory dataspace.
<P>As these examples illustrate, whenever we perform partial read/write operations on the data, the following information must be provided: file dataspace, file dataspace selection, memory dataspace and memory dataspace selection. After the required information is specified, actual read/write operation on the portion of data is done in a single call to the HDF5 read/write functions H5Dread(write).
<H5><A NAME="Intro-PMSelectHyper">Selecting hyperslabs</A></H5>
<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Hyperslabs are portions of datasets.  A hyperslab selection can be a logically contiguous collection of points in a dataspace, or it can be regular pattern of points or blocks in a dataspace.  The following picture illustrates a selection of regularly spaced 3x2 blocks in an 8x12 dataspace.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Four parameters are required to describe a completely general hyperslab.  Each parameter is an array whose rank is the same as that of the dataspace: 

<UL>
</FONT><CODE><LI>start</CODE>: a starting location for the hyperslab.  In the example <CODE>start</CODE> is (1,0). 
<CODE><LI>stride</CODE>: the number of elements to separate each element or block to be selected.  In the example <CODE>stride</CODE><I> </I> is (4,3).  If the stride parameter is set to NULL, the stride size defaults to 1 in each dimension.
<CODE><LI>count</CODE>: the number of elements or blocks to select along each dimension.  In the example, <CODE>count</CODE> is (2,4).
<CODE><LI>block</CODE>: the size of the block selected from the dataspace.  In the example, <CODE>block</CODE> is (3,2).  If the block parameter is set to NULL, the block size defaults to a single element in each dimension, as if the block array was set to all 1s.</UL>

<B><P>In what order is data copied?  </B>When actual I/O is performed data values are copied by default from one dataspace to another in so-called row-major, or C order.  That is, it is assumed that the first dimension varies slowest, the second next slowest, and so forth.

</CODE><FONT FACE="Times"><P>This describes the dataspace from which we wish to read. We need to define the dataspace in memory analogously.

<P>Notice that the values are inserted in the file dataset in row-major order.
<P><a href="#WriteSelected">Example 3</a> includes this code and other example code illustrating the use of hyperslab selection.
<H5><A NAME="Intro-PMSelectPoints">Selecting a list of independent points</A></H5>
A hyperslab specifies a regular pattern of elements in a dataset.  It is also possible to specify a list of independent elements to read or write using the function <CODE>H5Sselect_elements</CODE>.  Suppose, for example, that we wish to write the values 53, 59, 61, 67 to the following elements of the 8x12 array used in the previous example: (0,0), (3,3), (3,5), and (5,6).  The following code selects the points and writes them to the dataset:
<pre>
#define FSPACE_RANK      2    /* Dataset rank as it is stored in the file */
#define NPOINTS          4    /* Number of points that will be selected 
                                 and overwritten */ 
#define MSPACE2_RANK     1    /* Rank of the second dataset in memory */ 
#define MSPACE2_DIM      4    /* Dataset size in memory */ 

&nbsp;
hsize_t dim2[] = {MSPACE2_DIM};       /* Dimension size of the second 
                                         dataset (in memory) */ 
int     values[] = {53, 59, 61, 67};  /* New values to be written */
hssize_t coord[NPOINTS][FSPACE_RANK]; /* Array to store selected points 
                                         from the file dataspace */ 

/*
 * Create dataspace for the second dataset.
 */
mid2 = H5Screate_simple(MSPACE2_RANK, dim2, NULL);

/*
 * Select sequence of NPOINTS points in the file dataspace.
 */
coord[0][0] = 0; coord[0][1] = 0;
coord[1][0] = 3; coord[1][1] = 3;
coord[2][0] = 3; coord[2][1] = 5;
coord[3][0] = 5; coord[3][1] = 6;

ret = H5Sselect_elements(fid, H5S_SELECT_SET, NPOINTS, 
                         (const hssize_t **)coord);

/*
 * Write new selection of points to the dataset.
 */
ret = H5Dwrite(dataset, H5T_NATIVE_INT, mid2, fid, H5P_DEFAULT, values);

<H5><A NAME="_SelectUnion">Selecting a union of hyperslabs</A></H5>

</font>
The HDF5 Library allows the user to select a union of hyperslabs and 
write or read the selection into another selection.  The shapes of
the two selections may differ, but the number of elements must be equal.
<p>
Suppose that we want to read two overlapping hyperslabs from the dataset 
written in the previous example into a union of hyperslabs in the memory 
dataset.  This exercise is illustrated in the two figures immediately below.
Note that the memory dataset has a different shape from the previously
written dataset.  Similarly, the selection in the memory dataset
could have a different shape than the selected union of hyperslabs in 
the original file; for simplicity, we will preserve the selection's shape
in this example.

<p>
The following lines of code show the required steps.
<p>
First obtain the dataspace identifier for the dataset in the file.

<pre>
    /*
     * Get dataspace of the open dataset.
     */  
    fid = H5Dget_space(dataset);
</pre>

Then select the hyperslab with the size 3x4 and 
the left upper corner at the position (1,2):

<pre>
    /*
     * Select first hyperslab for the dataset in the file. The following
     * elements are selected:
     *                     10  0 11 12
     *                     18  0 19 20
     *                      0 59  0 61
     *   
     */ 
    start[0] = 1; start[1] = 2;
    block[0] = 1; block[1] = 1;
    stride[0] = 1; stride[1] = 1;
    count[0]  = 3; count[1]  = 4;
    ret = H5Sselect_hyperslab(fid, H5S_SELECT_SET, start, stride, count, block); 
</pre>

Now select the second hyperslab with the size 6x5 at the position (2,4), 
and create the union with the first hyperslab.

<pre>
    /*
     * Add second selected hyperslab to the selection.
     * The following elements are selected:
     *                    19 20  0 21 22
     *                     0 61  0  0  0
     *                    27 28  0 29 30
     *                    35 36 67 37 38
     *                    43 44  0 45 46
     *                     0  0  0  0  0
     * Note that two hyperslabs overlap. Common elements are:
     *                                              19 20
     *                                               0 61
     */
    start[0] = 2; start[1] = 4;
    block[0] = 1; block[1] = 1;
    stride[0] = 1; stride[1] = 1;
    count[0]  = 6; count[1]  = 5;
    ret = H5Sselect_hyperslab(fid, H5S_SELECT_OR, start, stride, count, block);
</pre>
 
Note that when we add the selected hyperslab to the union, the 
second argument to the <code>H5Sselect_hyperslab</code> function 
has to be <code>H5S_SELECT_OR</code> instead of <code>H5S_SELECT_SET</code>. 
Using <code>H5S_SELECT_SET</code> would reset the selection to 
the second hyperslab.
<p>
Now define the memory dataspace and select the union of the hyperslabs 
in the memory dataset.

<pre>
    /*
     * Create memory dataspace.
     */
    mid = H5Screate_simple(MSPACE_RANK, mdim, NULL);
     
    /*
     * Select two hyperslabs in memory. Hyperslabs has the same
     * size and shape as the selected hyperslabs for the file dataspace.
     */
    start[0] = 0; start[1] = 0;
    block[0] = 1; block[1] = 1;
    stride[0] = 1; stride[1] = 1;
    count[0]  = 3; count[1]  = 4;
    ret = H5Sselect_hyperslab(mid, H5S_SELECT_SET, start, stride, count, block);     
    start[0] = 1; start[1] = 2;
    block[0] = 1; block[1] = 1;
    stride[0] = 1; stride[1] = 1;
    count[0]  = 6; count[1]  = 5;
    ret = H5Sselect_hyperslab(mid, H5S_SELECT_OR, start, stride, count, block);
</pre>
     
Finally we can read the selected data from the file dataspace to the selection
in memory with one call to the <code>H5Dread</code> function.

<pre>    ret = H5Dread(dataset, H5T_NATIVE_INT, mid, fid, H5P_DEFAULT, matrix_out);
</pre>

</FONT><H4><A NAME="Intro-PMCreateCompound">Creating compound datatypes</A></H4>
<B><P>Properties of compound datatypes. </B>A compound datatype is similar to a struct in C or a common block in Fortran. It is a collection of one or more atomic types or small arrays of such types. To create and use of a compound datatype you need to refer to various <i>properties</i> of the data compound datatype:

<UL>
<LI>It is of class <i>compound</i><I>.</I> 
<LI>It has a fixed total <i>size</i>, in bytes. 
<LI>It consists of zero or more <i>members</i> (defined in any order) with unique names and which occupy non-overlapping regions within the datum. 
<LI>Each member has its own <i>datatype</i>. 
<LI>Each member is referenced by an <i>index number</i> between zero and N-1, where N is the number of members in the compound datatype. 
<LI>Each member has a <i>name</i> which is unique among its siblings in a compound data type. 
<LI>Each member has a fixed <i>byte offset</i>, which is the first byte (smallest byte address) of that member in a compound datatype. 
<LI>Each member can be a small array of up to four dimensions.</UL>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Properties of members of a compound data type are defined when the member is added to the compound type and cannot be subsequently modified.
<B><P>Defining compound datatypes. </B>Compound datatypes must be built out of other datatypes. First, one creates an empty compound data type and specifies its total size. Then members are added to the compound data type in any order.
<I><P>Member names. </I>Each member must have a descriptive name, which is the key used to uniquely identify the member within the compound data type. A member name in an HDF5 data type does not necessarily have to be the same as the name of the corresponding member in the C struct in memory, although this is often the case. Nor does one need to define all members of the C struct in the HDF5 compound data type (or vice versa). 
<I><P>Offsets. </I>Usually a C struct will be defined to hold a data point in memory, and the offsets of the members in memory will be the offsets of the struct members from the beginning of an instance of the struct. The library defines the macro to compute the offset of a member within a struct:
</FONT><CODE><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;HOFFSET(s,m)<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></CODE>
<br><FONT FACE="Times">This macro computes the offset of member </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier"><EM>m</EM> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">within a struct variable <EM>s</EM>. 
<P>Here is an example in which a compound data type is created to describe complex numbers whose type is defined by the </FONT><CODE>complex_t</CODE><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">struct. 
</FONT><CODE><PRE>typedef struct {

<P>For example, you can create and store the following 3x3 HDF5 dataset:
</FONT><PRE>     1 1 1
     1 1 1 
     1 1 1 </PRE>
<FONT FACE="Times"><P>then later to extend this into a 10x3 dataset by adding 7 rows, such as this:

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>HDF 5 requires you to use <I>chunking</I> in order to define extendible datasets. Chunking makes it possible to extend datasets efficiently, without having to reorganize storage excessively. 
<P>The following operations are required in order to write an extendible dataset:
<OL>

<LI>Declare the dataspace of the dataset to have <I>unlimited dimensions</I> for all dimensions that might eventually be extended.
<LI>Set dataset creation properties to enable chunking and create a dataset.
<LI>Extend the size of the dataset.</OL>

<P>For example, suppose we wish to create a dataset similar to the one shown above. We want to start with a 3x3 dataset, then later extend it in both directions. 
<B><P>Declaring unlimited dimensions. </B>We could declare the dataspace to have unlimited dimensions with the following code, which uses the predefined constant </FONT><CODE>H5S_UNLIMITED</CODE><FONT FACE="Times"> to specify unlimited dimensions.
</FONT><PRE>hsize_t dims[2] = { 3, 3}; /* dataset dimensions

hsize_t maxdims[2] = {H5S_UNLIMITED, H5S_UNLIMITED};
/*
 * Create the data space with unlimited dimensions. 
 */
dataspace = H5Screate_simple(RANK, dims, maxdims); </PRE>
<B><P>Enabling chunking.  </B>We can then set the dataset storage layout properties to enable chunking.  We do this using the routine <CODE>H5Pset_chunk</CODE><FONT SIZE=4>:
</FONT><PRE>hid_t cparms;

/* 
 * Modify dataset creation properties to enable chunking.

cparms = H5Pcreate (H5P_DATASET_CREATE);

Then create a dataset.
<pre>

 * creation properties.
 */
dataset = H5Dcreate(file, DATASETNAME, H5T_NATIVE_INT, dataspace,
                 cparms);
</pre>

<B><P>Extending dataset size.  </B>Finally, when we want to extend the size of the dataset, we invoke <CODE>H5Dextend </CODE>to extend the size of the dataset.  In the following example, we extend the dataset along the first dimension, by seven rows, so that the new dimensions are <CODE>&lt;10,3&gt;</CODE>:
<PRE>/*

dims[0] = dims[0] + 7;

<H4><A NAME="Intro-PMWorkGroups">Working with groups in a file</A></H4>
<P>Groups provide a mechanism for organizing meaningful and extendible sets of datasets within an HDF5 file. The H5G API contains routines for working with groups. 
<B><P>Creating a group. </B>To create a group, use 
<CODE>H5Gcreate</CODE>.  For example, the following code 
creates a group called <code>Data</code> in the root group.
<pre>
 /*
  *  Create a group in the file.
  */
 grp = H5Gcreate(file, "/Data", 0);
</pre>
A group may be created in another group by providing the 
absolute name of the group to the <code>H5Gcreate</code> 
function or by specifying its location.  For example, 
to create the group <code>Data_new</code> in the 
<code>Data</code> group, one can use the following sequence 
of calls:
<pre>
 /*
  * Create group "Data_new" in the group "Data" by specifying
  * absolute name of the group.
  */
 grp_new = H5Gcreate(file, "/Data/Data_new", 0);
</pre>
or
<pre>
 /*
  * Create group "Data_new" in the "Data" group.
  */
 grp_new = H5Gcreate(grp, "Data_new", 0);
</pre>
Note that the group identifier <code>grp</code> is used 
as the first parameter in the <code>H5Gcreate</code> function 
when the relative name is provided.   
<p>
The third parameter in <code>H5Gcreate</code> optionally 
specifies how much file space to reserve to store the names 
that will appear in this group.  If a non-positive
value is supplied, then a default size is chosen.
<p>
<code>H5Gclose</code> closes the group and releases the 
group identifier.
<p>

<b>Creating a dataset in a particular group.</b>
As with groups, a dataset can be created in a particular 
group by specifying its absolute name as illustrated in 
the following example:

<pre> 
 /*
  * Create the dataset "Compressed_Data" in the group using the 
  * absolute name. The dataset creation property list is modified 
  * to use GZIP compression with the compression effort set to 6.
  * Note that compression can be used only when the dataset is 
  * chunked.
  */
 dims[0] = 1000;
 dims[1] = 20;
 cdims[0] = 20;
 cdims[1] = 20;
 dataspace = H5Screate_simple(RANK, dims, NULL);
 plist     = H5Pcreate(H5P_DATASET_CREATE);
             H5Pset_chunk(plist, 2, cdims);
             H5Pset_deflate( plist, 6);
 dataset = H5Dcreate(file, "/Data/Compressed_Data", H5T_NATIVE_INT,
                     dataspace, plist);
</pre>
A relative dataset name may also be used when a dataset is 
created.  First obtain the identifier of the group in which 
the dataset is to be created.  Then create the dataset
with <code>H5Dcreate</code> as illustrated in the following 
example:
<pre>
 /* 
  * Open the group.
  */
 grp = H5Gopen(file, "Data");

 /*
  * Create the dataset "Compressed_Data" in the "Data" group
  * by providing a group identifier and a relative dataset 
  * name as parameters to the H5Dcreate function.
  */
 dataset = H5Dcreate(grp, "Compressed_Data", H5T_NATIVE_INT,
                     dataspace, plist);
</pre>
<p>

<b>Accessing an object in a group.</b>
Any object in a group can be accessed by its absolute or 
relative name.  The following lines of code show how to use 
the absolute name to access the dataset 
<code>Compressed_Data</code> in the group <code>Data</code> 
created in the examples above:
<pre>
  /*
   * Open the dataset "Compressed_Data" in the "Data" group. 
   */
  dataset = H5Dopen(file, "/Data/Compressed_Data");
</pre>
The same dataset can be accessed in another manner.  First
access the group to which the dataset belongs, then open 
the dataset. 
<pre>
  /*
   * Open the group "data" in the file.
   */
  grp  = H5Gopen(file, "Data");
 
  /*
   * Access the "Compressed_Data" dataset in the group.
   */
  dataset = H5Dopen(grp, "Compressed_Data");
</pre>

<p>
<A HREF="#CreateGroups">Example 7</A> shows 
how to create a group in a file and a 
dataset in a group.  It uses the iterator function 
<code>H5Giterate</code> to find the names of the objects
in the root group, and <code>H5Glink</code> and <code>H5Gunlink</code>
to create a new group name and delete the original name.


<H4><A NAME="Intro-PMWorkAttributes">Working with attributes</A></H4>
<P>Think of an attribute as a small datasets that is attached to a normal dataset or group.  The H5A API contains routines for working with attributes.  Since attributes share many of the characteristics of datasets, the programming model for working with attributes is analogous in many ways to the model for working with datasets.  The primary differences are that an attribute must be attached to a dataset or a group, and subsetting operations cannot be performed on attributes.
<B><P>To create an attribute </B>belonging to a particular dataset or group<B>, </B>first create a dataspace for the attribute with the call to <CODE>H5Screate</CODE>, then create the attribute using <CODE>H5Acreate</CODE>.  For example, the following code creates an attribute called <CODE> Integer_attribute </CODE>that is a member of a dataset whose identifier is <CODE>dataset</CODE>. The attribute identifier is <CODE>attr2</CODE>.<CODE> H5Awrite</CODE> then sets the value of the attribute of that of the integer variable <CODE>point</code>. <code>H5Aclose</code> <FONT FACE="Times">then releases the attribute identifier.
</CODE>

<pre>
int point = 1;                         /* Value of the scalar attribute */ 

/*

aid2  = H5Screate(H5S_SCALAR);
attr2 = H5Acreate(dataset, "Integer attribute", H5T_NATIVE_INT, aid2,

ret = H5Sclose(aid2); 

/*

ret = H5Aclose(attr2); 
</pre>
<CODE><P>&nbsp;
</CODE><B><P>To read a scalar attribute whose name and datatype are known</B>, first open the attribute using <CODE>H5Aopen_name</CODE>, then use H5Aread to get its value.

<pre>
/*

attr = H5Aopen_name(dataset,"Integer attribute");
ret  = H5Aread(attr, H5T_NATIVE_INT, &amp;point_out);

</FONT><B><P>Reading an attribute whose characteristics are not known. </B>It may be necessary to query a<FONT FACE="Times"> file to obtain information about an attribute, namely its name, data type, rank and dimensions.

<code>
</CODE><P>In practice, if the characteristics of attributes are not know, the code involved in accessing and processing the attribute can be quite complex.  For this reason, HDF5 includes a function called <CODE>H5Aiterate</CODE>, which applies a user-supplied function to each of a set of attributes.  The user-supplied function can contain the code that interprets, accesses and processes each attribute.

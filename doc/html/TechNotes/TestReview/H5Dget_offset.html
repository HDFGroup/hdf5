<P>Because dataset is stored in chunks that are indexed by a B-tree, there is
no single piece of data to query the offset of.
</P>
<P>It may be possible in the future to
enhance this function by querying the offset of a particular chunk (or chunks),
but that has limited use because chunks could be compressed, etc. with an I/O
filter.

<P>Because dataset is stored in the object header of the dataset, there is
no separate piece of data to query the offset of.
</P>
<P>It may be possible in the future to get the offset of the data in the object
header, but this is problematic due to the fact that the messages in the object
header can get relocated in the file when changes (like adding attributes, etc.)
are made to the dataset, invalidating the address given to the user.

<P>In theory, it's easy to return the offset of the data in the external file,
but this wasn't done because it would be too easy for users to assume that the
offset returned was in the HDF5 file instead of the external file.

<P>The H5Dget_offset() function is not tested in parallel.  Currently, there

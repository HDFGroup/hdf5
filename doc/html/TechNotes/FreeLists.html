<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h1>Memory Management and Free Lists</h1>

<pre>

At Release 1.2.2, free list management code was introduced to the HDF5 
library.  This included one user-level function, H5garbage_collect, which 
garbage collects on all the free-lists.  H5garbage_collect is the only user-
accessible (i.e., application developer-accessible) element of this 
functionality.

The free-lists generally reduce the amount of dynamic memory used to around 
75% of the pre-optimized amount as well as speed up the time in the library 
code by ~5% The free-lists also help linearize the amount of memory used with 
increasing numbers of datasets or re-writes on the data, so the amount of 
memory used for the 1500/45 free-list case is only 66% of the memory used for 
the unoptimized case.

Overall, the introduction of free list management is a win: the library is 
slightly faster and uses much less system resources than before.  Most of the
emphasis has been focused on the main "thouroughfares" through the code;
less attention was paid to the "back streets" which are used much less 
frequently and offer less potential for abuse.

Adding a free-list for a data structure in the HDF5 library code is easy:

Old code:
---------
    int foo(void)
    {
        H5W_t *w;

        for(i=0; i&lt;x; i++) {
            w=H5MM_malloc(sizeof(H5W_t));
            &lt;use w&gt;
            H5MM_xfree(w);
        }
    }

New code:
---------
H5FL_DEFINE(H5W_t);

    int foo(void)
    {
        H5W_t *w;

        for(i=0; i&lt;x; i++) {
            w=H5FL_ALLOC(H5W_t,0);
            &lt;use w&gt;
            H5FL_FREE(H5W_t,w);
        }
    }


There are three kinds of free-lists: 
   -- for "regular" objects, 
   -- arrays of fixed size object (both fixed length and unknown length), and 
   -- "blocks" of bytes.  
 
   "Regular" free-lists use the H5FL_&lt;*&gt; macros in H5FLprivate.h and are
   designed for single, fixed-size data structures like typedef'ed structs,
   etc.  

   Arrays of objects use the H5FL_ARR_&lt;*&gt; macros and are designed for arrays 
   (both fixed in length and varying lengths) of fixed length data structures 
   (like typedef'ed types).  

   "Block" free-lists use the H5FL_BLK_&lt;*&gt; macros and are designed to hold 
   varying sized buffers of bytes, with no structure.  

   H5S.c contains examples for "regular" and fixed-sized arrays;
   H5B.c contains examples for variable-sized arrays and "blocks".

A free-list doesn't have to be used for every data structure allocated and
freed, just for those which are prone to abuse when multiple operations are
being performed.  It is important to use the macros for declaring and
manipulating the free-lists however; they allow the free'd objects on the 
lists to be garbage collected by the library at the library's termination 
or at the user's request.

One public API function has been added: H5garbage_collect, which garbage 
collects on all the free-lists of all the different types.  It's not required 
to be called and is only necessary in situations when the application 
performs actions which cause the library to allocate many objects and then 
the application eventually releases those objects and wants to reduce the 
memory used by the library from the peak usage required.  The library 
automatically garbage collects all the free lists when the application ends.

This document is of interest primarily for its discussion of the
HDF team's motivation for implementing raw data caching.  
At a more abstract level, the discussion of the principles of 
data chunking is also of interest, but a more recent discussion 
of that topic can be found in 
<a href="../Chunking.html">Dataset Chunking Issues</a> in the 
<cite><a href="../H5.user.html">HDF5 User's Guide</a></cite>.

The performance study described here predates the current chunking 
implementation in the HDF5 library, so the particular performance data 
is no longer apropos.

    <h1>Testing the chunked layout of HDF5</h1>

    <p>This is the results of studying the chunked layout policy in
      HDF5. A 1000 by 1000 array of integers was written to a file
      dataset extending the dataset with each write to create, in the
      end, a 5000 by 5000 array of 4-byte integers for a total data
      storage size of 100 million bytes.

      </center>

    <p>After the array was written, it was read back in blocks that
      were 500 by 500 bytes in row major order (that is, the top-left
      quadrant of output block one, then the top-right quadrant of
      output block one, then the top-left quadrant of output block 2,
      etc.).

    <p>I tried to answer two questions:
    <ul>
      <li>How does the storage overhead change as the chunk size
	changes?
      <li>What does the disk seek pattern look like as the chunk size
	changes?
    </ul>

    <p>I started with chunk sizes that were multiples of the read
      block size or k*(500, 500).

    <p>The first half of Figure 2 shows output to the file while the
      second half shows input.  Each dot represents a file-level I/O
      request and the lines that connect the dots are for visual
      clarity. The size of the request is not indicated in the
      graph. The output block size is four times the chunk size which
      results in four file-level write requests per block for a total
      of 100 requests. Since file space for the chunks was allocated
      in output order, and the input block size is 1/4 the output
      block size, the input shows a staircase effect.  Each input
      request results in one file-level read request. The downward
      spike at about the 60-millionth byte is probably the result of a
      cache miss for the B-tree and the downward spike at the end is
      probably a cache flush or file boot block update.

	<br><b>Fig 2: Chunk size is 1000x1000</b>
      </center>

    <p>In this test I increased the chunk size to match the output
      chunk size and one can see from the first half of the graph that
      25 file-level write requests were issued, one for each output
      block.  The read half of the test shows that four times the
      amount of data was read as written.  This results from the fact
      that HDF5 must read the entire chunk for any request that falls
      within that chunk, which is done because (1) if the data is
      compressed the entire chunk must be decompressed, and (2) the
      library assumes that a chunk size was chosen to optimize disk
      performance.

	<br><b>Fig 3: Chunk size is 5000x1000</b>
      </center>

    <p>Increasing the chunk size further results in even worse
      performance since both the read and write halves of the test are
      re-reading and re-writing vast amounts of data.  This proves
      that one should be careful that chunk sizes are not much larger
      than the typical partial I/O request.

      </center>

    <p>If the chunk size is decreased then the amount of data
      transfered between the disk and library is optimal for no
      caching, but the amount of meta data required to describe the
      chunk locations increases to 250 parts per million.  One can
      also see that the final downward spike contains more file-level
      write requests as the meta data is flushed to disk just before
      the file is closed.

	<img alt="499x499" src="ChStudy_499x499.gif">
	<br><b>Fig 4: Chunk size is 499x499</b>
      </center>

    <p>This test shows the result of choosing a chunk size which is 
      close to the I/O block size.  Because the total size of the
      array isn't a multiple of the chunk size, the library allocates
      an extra zone of chunks around the top and right edges of the
      array which are only partially filled.  This results in
      20,516,484 extra bytes of storage, a 20% increase in the total
      raw data storage size.  But the amount of meta data overhead is
      the same as for the 500 by 500 test.  In addition, the mismatch
      causes entire chunks to be read in order to update a few
      elements along the edge or the chunk which results in a 3.6-fold
      increase in the amount of data transfered.

<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="VFL.html#TOC1">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
The HDF5 file format describes how HDF5 data structures and dataset raw
data are mapped to a linear <STRONG>format address space</STRONG> and the HDF5
library implements that bidirectional mapping in terms of an
API. However, the HDF5 format specifications do <EM>not</EM> indicate how
the format address space is mapped onto storage and HDF (version 5 and
earlier) simply mapped the format address space directly onto a single
file by convention.

</P>
<P>
Since early versions of HDF5 it became apparent that users want the ability to
map the format address space onto different types of storage (a single file,
multiple files, local memory, global memory, network distributed global
memory, a network protocol, <I>etc</I>.) with various types of maps. For
instance, some users want to be able to handle very large format address
spaces on operating systems that support only 2GB files by partitioning the
format address space into equal-sized parts each served by a separate
file. Other users want the same multi-file storage capability but want to
partition the address space according to purpose (raw data in one file, object
headers in another, global heap in a third, <I>etc.</I>) in order to improve I/O
speeds.

</P>
<P>
In fact, the number of storage variations is probably larger than the
number of methods that the HDF5 team is capable of implementing and
supporting. Therefore, a <STRONG>Virtual File Layer</STRONG> API is being
implemented which will allow application teams or departments to design
and implement their own mapping between the HDF5 format address space
and storage, with each mapping being a separate <STRONG>file driver</STRONG>
(possibly written in terms of other file drivers). The HDF5 team will
provide a small set of useful file drivers which will also serve as
examples for those who which to write their own:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>H5FD_SEC2</CODE>
<DD>
This is the default driver which uses Posix file-system functions like
<CODE>read</CODE> and <CODE>write</CODE> to perform I/O to a single file. All I/O
requests are unbuffered although the driver does optimize file seeking
operations to some extent.

<DT><CODE>H5FD_STDIO</CODE>
<DD>
This driver uses functions from <TT>`stdio.h'</TT> to perform buffered I/O
to a single file.

<DT><CODE>H5FD_CORE</CODE>
<DD>
This driver performs I/O directly to memory and can be used to create small
temporary files that never exist on permanent storage. This type of storage is
generally very fast since the I/O consists only of memory-to-memory copy
operations.

<DT><CODE>H5FD_MPIIO</CODE>
<DD>
This is the driver of choice for accessing files in parallel using MPI and
MPI-IO.  It is only predefined if the library is compiled with parallel I/O
support.

<DT><CODE>H5FD_FAMILY</CODE>
<DD>
Large format address spaces are partitioned into more manageable pieces and
sent to separate storage locations using an underlying driver of the user's
choice.  The <CODE>h5repart</CODE> tool can be used to change the sizes of the
family members when stored as files or to convert a family of files to a
single file or vice versa.

<DT><CODE>H5FD_SPLIT</CODE>
<DD>
The format address space is split into meta data and raw data and each is
mapped onto separate storage using underlying drivers of the user's
choice. The meta data storage can be read by itself (for limited
functionality) or both files can be accessed together.
</DL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="VFL.html#TOC2">Using a File Driver</A></H1>

<P>
Most application writers will use a driver defined by the HDF5 library or
contributed by another programming team. This chapter describes how existing
drivers are used.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="VFL.html#TOC3">Driver Header Files</A></H2>

<P>
Each file driver is defined in its own public header file which should
be included by any application which plans to use that driver. The
predefined drivers are in header files whose names begin with
<SAMP>`H5FD'</SAMP> followed by the driver name and <SAMP>`.h'</SAMP>. The <TT>`hdf5.h'</TT> 
header file includes all the predefined driver header files.

</P>
<P>
Once the appropriate header file is included a symbol of the form
<SAMP>`H5FD_'</SAMP> followed by the upper-case driver name will be the driver
identification number.<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="VFL.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>  However, the
value may change if the library is closed (<I>e.g.</I>, by calling
<CODE>H5close</CODE>) and the symbol is referenced again.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="VFL.html#TOC4">Creating and Opening Files</A></H2>

<P>
In order to create or open a file one must define the method by which the
storage is accessed<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="VFL.html#FOOT2">(2)</A> and does so by creating a file access property list<A NAME="DOCF3" HREF="VFL.html#FOOT3">(3)</A> which is passed to the <CODE>H5Fcreate</CODE> or
<CODE>H5Fopen</CODE> function.  A default file access property list is created by
calling <CODE>H5Pcreate</CODE> and then the file driver information is inserted by
calling a driver initialization function such as <CODE>H5Pset_fapl_family</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
hid_t fapl = H5Pcreate(H5P_FILE_ACCESS);
size_t member_size = 100*1024*1024; /*100MB*/
H5Pset_fapl_family(fapl, member_size, H5P_DEFAULT);
hid_t file = H5Fcreate("foo%05d.h5", H5F_ACC_TRUNC, H5P_DEFAULT, fapl);
H5Pclose(fapl);
</PRE>

<P>
Each file driver will have its own initialization function
whose name is <CODE>H5Pset_fapl_</CODE> followed by the driver name and which
takes a file access property list as the first argument followed by
additional driver-dependent arguments.

</P>
<P>
An alternative to using the driver initialization function is to set the
driver directly using the <CODE>H5Pset_driver</CODE> function.<A NAME="DOCF4" HREF="VFL.html#FOOT4">(4)</A> Its second argument is the file driver identifier, which may
have a different numeric value from run to run depending on the order in which
the file drivers are registered with the library. The third argument
encapsulates the additional arguments of the driver initialization
function. This method only works if the file driver writer has made the
driver-specific property list structure a public datatype, which is
often not the case.

</P>

<PRE>
hid_t fapl = H5Pcreate(H5P_FILE_ACCESS);
static H5FD_family_fapl_t fa = {100*1024*1024, H5P_DEFAULT};
H5Pset_driver(fapl, H5FD_FAMILY, &#38;fa);
hid_t file = H5Fcreate("foo.h5", H5F_ACC_TRUNC, H5P_DEFAULT, fapl);
H5Pclose(fapl);
</PRE>

<P>
It is also possible to query the file driver information from a file access
property list by calling <CODE>H5Pget_driver</CODE> to determine the driver and then 
calling a driver-defined query function to obtain the driver information:

</P>

<PRE>
hid_t driver = H5Pget_driver(fapl);
if (H5FD_SEC2==driver) {
    /*nothing further to get*/
} else if (H5FD_FAMILY==driver) {
    hid_t member_fapl;
    haddr_t member_size;
    H5Pget_fapl_family(fapl, &#38;member_size, &#38;member_fapl);
} else if (....) {
    ....
}
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="VFL.html#TOC5">Performing I/O</A></H2>

<P>
The <CODE>H5Dread</CODE> and <CODE>H5Dwrite</CODE> functions transfer data between
application memory and the file. They both take an optional data transfer
property list which has some general driver-independent properties and
optional driver-defined properties. An application will typically perform I/O
in one of three styles via the <CODE>H5Dread</CODE> or <CODE>H5Dwrite</CODE> function:

</P>
<P>
Like file access properties in the previous section, data transfer properties
can be set using a driver initialization function or a general purpose
function. For example, to set the MPI-IO driver to use independent access for
I/O operations one would say:

</P>

<PRE>
hid_t dxpl = H5Pcreate(H5P_DATA_XFER);
H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(dxpl, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);
H5Dread(dataset, type, mspace, fspace, buffer, dxpl);
H5Pclose(dxpl);
</PRE>

<P>
The alternative is to initialize a driver defined C <CODE>struct</CODE> and pass it
to the <CODE>H5Pset_driver</CODE> function:

</P>

<PRE>
hid_t dxpl = H5Pcreate(H5P_DATA_XFER);
static H5FD_mpio_dxpl_t dx = {H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT};
H5Pset_driver(dxpl, H5FD_MPIO, &#38;dx);
H5Dread(dataset, type, mspace, fspace, buffer, dxpl);
</PRE>

<P>
The transfer propery list can be queried in a manner similar to the file
access property list: the driver provides a function (or functions) to return
various information about the transfer property list:

</P>

<PRE>
hid_t driver = H5Pget_driver(dxpl);
if (H5FD_MPIO==driver) {
    H5FD_mpio_xfer_t xfer_mode;
    H5Pget_dxpl_mpio(dxpl, &#38;xfer_mode);
} else {
    ....
}
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="VFL.html#TOC6">File Driver Interchangeability</A></H2>

<P>
The HDF5 specifications describe two things: the mapping of data onto a linear 
<STRONG>format address space</STRONG> and the C API which performs the mapping.
However, the mapping of the format address space onto storage intentionally
falls outside the scope of the HDF5 specs. This is a direct result of the fact 
that it is not generally possible to store information about how to access
storage inside the storage itself. For instance, given only the file name
<TT>`/arborea/1225/work/f%03d'</TT> the HDF5 library is unable to tell whether the 
name refers to a file on the local file system, a family of files on the local 
file system, a file on host <SAMP>`arborea'</SAMP> port 1225, a family of files on a
remote system, <I>etc</I>.

</P>
<P>
Two ways which library could figure out where the storage is located are:
storage access information can be provided by the user, or the library can try
all known file access methods. This implementation uses the former method.

</P>
<P>
In general, if a file was created with one driver then it isn't possible to
open it with another driver. There are of course exceptions: a file created
with MPIO could probably be opened with the sec2 driver, any file created
by the sec2 driver could be opened as a family of files with one member,
<I>etc</I>.  In fact, sometimes a file must not only be opened with the same
driver but also with the same driver properties. The predefined drivers are
written in such a way that specifying the correct driver is sufficient for
opening a file.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="VFL.html#TOC7">Implementation of a Driver</A></H1>

<P>
A driver is simply a collection of functions and data structures which are
registered with the HDF5 library at runtime. The functions fall into these
categories:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Functions which operate on modes

<LI>Functions which operate on files

<LI>Functions which operate on the address space

<LI>Functions which operate on data

<LI>Functions for driver initialization

<LI>Optimization functions

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="VFL.html#TOC8">Mode Functions</A></H2>

<P>
Some drivers need information about file access and data transfers which are
very specific to the driver. The information is usually implemented as a pair
of pointers to C structs which are allocated and initialized as part of an
HDF5 property list and passed down to various driver functions. There are two
classes of settings: file access modes that describe how to access the file
through the driver, and data transfer modes which are settings that control
I/O operations.  Each file opened by a particular driver may have a different
access mode; each dataset I/O request for a particular file may have a
different data transfer mode.

</P>
<P>
Since each driver has its own particular requirements for various settings,
each driver is responsible for defining the mode structures that it
needs. Higher layers of the library treat the structures as opaque but must be
able to copy and free them. Thus, the driver provides either the size of the
structure or a pair of function pointers for each of the mode types.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG> The family driver needs to know how the format address
space is partitioned and the file access property list to use for the
family members. 

</P>

<PRE>
/* Driver-specific file access properties */
typedef struct H5FD_family_fapl_t {
    hsize_t     memb_size;      /*size of each member                   */
    hid_t       memb_fapl_id;   /*file access property list of each memb*/
} H5FD_family_fapl_t;

/* Driver specific data transfer properties */
typedef struct H5FD_family_dxpl_t {
    hid_t       memb_dxpl_id;   /*data xfer property list of each memb  */
} H5FD_family_dxpl_t;
</PRE>

<P>
In order to copy or free one of these structures the member file access
or data transfer properties must also be copied or freed. This is done
by providing a copy and close function for each structure:

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG> The file access property list copy and close functions 
for the family driver:

</P>

<PRE>
static void *
H5FD_family_fapl_copy(const void *_old_fa)
{
    const H5FD_family_fapl_t *old_fa = (const H5FD_family_fapl_t*)_old_fa;
    H5FD_family_fapl_t *new_fa = malloc(sizeof(H5FD_family_fapl_t));
    assert(new_fa);

    memcpy(new_fa, old_fa, sizeof(H5FD_family_fapl_t));
    new_fa-&#62;memb_fapl_id = H5Pcopy(old_fa-&#62;memb_fapl_id);
    return new_fa;
}

static herr_t
H5FD_family_fapl_free(void *_fa)
{
    H5FD_family_fapl_t  *fa = (H5FD_family_fapl_t*)_fa;
    H5Pclose(fa-&#62;memb_fapl_id);
    free(fa);
    return 0;
}
</PRE>

<P>
Generally when a file is created or opened the file access properties
for the driver are copied into the file pointer which is returned and
they may be modified from their original value (for instance, the file
family driver modifies the member size property when opening an existing 
family). In order to support the <CODE>H5Fget_access_plist</CODE> function the 
driver must provide a <CODE>fapl_get</CODE> callback which creates a copy of
the driver-specific properties based on a particular file.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG> The file family driver copies the member size file
access property list into the return value:

</P>

<PRE>
static void *
H5FD_family_fapl_get(H5FD_t *_file)
{
    H5FD_family_t	*file = (H5FD_family_t*)_file;
    H5FD_family_fapl_t	*fa = calloc(1, sizeof(H5FD_family_fapl_t*));

    fa-&#62;memb_size = file-&#62;memb_size;
    fa-&#62;memb_fapl_id = H5Pcopy(file-&#62;memb_fapl_id);
    return fa;
}
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="VFL.html#TOC9">File Functions</A></H2>

<P>
The higher layers of the library expect files to have a name and allow the
file to be accessed in various modes. The driver must be able to create a new
file, replace an existing file, or open an existing file. Opening or creating
a file should return a handle, a pointer to a specialization of the
<CODE>H5FD_t</CODE> struct, which allows read-only or read-write access and which
will be passed to the other driver functions as they are
called.<A NAME="DOCF5" HREF="VFL.html#FOOT5">(5)</A>

</P>

<PRE>
typedef struct {
    /* Public fields */
    H5FD_class_t *cls; /*class data defined below*/

    /* Private fields -- driver-defined */

} H5FD_t;
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG> The family driver requires handles to the underlying
storage, the size of the members for this particular file (which might be
different than the member size specified in the file access property list if
an existing file family is being opened), the name used to open the file in
case additional members must be created, and the flags to use for creating
those additional members. The <CODE>eoa</CODE> member caches the size of the format
address space so the family members don't have to be queried in order to find
it.

</P>

<PRE>
/* The description of a file belonging to this driver. */
typedef struct H5FD_family_t {
    H5FD_t      pub;            /*public stuff, must be first           */
    hid_t       memb_fapl_id;   /*file access property list for members */
    hsize_t     memb_size;      /*maximum size of each member file      */
    int         nmembs;         /*number of family members              */
    int         amembs;         /*number of member slots allocated      */
    H5FD_t      **memb;         /*dynamic array of member pointers      */
    haddr_t     eoa;            /*end of allocated addresses            */
    char        *name;          /*name generator printf format          */
    unsigned    flags;          /*flags for opening additional members  */
} H5FD_family_t;
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG> The sec2 driver needs to keep track of the underlying Unix
file descriptor and also the end of format address space and current Unix file
size. It also keeps track of the current file position and last operation
(read, write, or unknown) in order to optimize calls to <CODE>lseek</CODE>.  The
<CODE>device</CODE> and <CODE>inode</CODE> fields are defined on Unix in order to uniquely 
identify the file and will be discussed below.

</P>

<PRE>
typedef struct H5FD_sec2_t {
    H5FD_t      pub;                    /*public stuff, must be first   */
    int         fd;                     /*the unix file                 */

} H5FD_sec2_t;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="VFL.html#TOC10">Opening Files</A></H3>

<P>
All drivers must define a function for opening/creating a file. This
function should have a prototype which is:

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> static H5FD_t * <B>open</B> <I>(const char *<VAR>name</VAR>, unsigned <VAR>flags</VAR>, hid_t <VAR>fapl</VAR>, haddr_t <VAR>maxaddr</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1"></A>

</P>
<P>
The file name <VAR>name</VAR> and file access property list <VAR>fapl</VAR> are
the same as were specified in the <CODE>H5Fcreate</CODE> or <CODE>H5Fopen</CODE>
call. The <VAR>flags</VAR> are the same as in those calls also except the
flag <CODE>H5F_ACC_CREATE</CODE> is also present if the call was to
<CODE>H5Fcreate</CODE> and they are documented in the <TT>`H5Fpublic.h'</TT>
file. The <VAR>maxaddr</VAR> argument is the maximum format address that the
driver should be prepared to handle (the minimum address is always
zero).

Closing a file simply means that all cached data should be flushed to the next
lower layer, the file should be closed at the next lower layer, and all
file-related data structures should be freed. All information needed by the
close function is already present in the file handle.

The <VAR>file</VAR> argument is the handle which was returned by the <CODE>open</CODE>

driver-specific part of the handle (the public parts will have already been released by HDF5's virtual file layer).
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG> The sec2 driver just closes the underlying Unix file,
making sure that the actual file size is the same as that known to the
library by writing a zero to the last file position it hasn't been
written by some previous operation (which happens in the same code which
flushes the file contents and is shown below).

<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="VFL.html#TOC12">File Keys</A></H3>

<P>
Occasionally an application will attempt to open a single file more than one
time in order to obtain multiple handles to the file. HDF5 allows the files to
share information<A NAME="DOCF6" HREF="VFL.html#FOOT6">(6)</A> but in order to
accomplish this HDF5 must be able to tell when two names refer to the same
file. It does this by associating a driver-defined key with each file opened
by a driver and comparing the key for an open request with the keys for all
other files currently open by the same driver.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> const int <B>cmp</B> <I>(const H5FD_t *<VAR>f1</VAR>, const H5FD_t *<VAR>f2</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3"></A>

</P>
<P>
The driver may provide a function which compares two files <VAR>f1</VAR> and
<VAR>f2</VAR> belonging to the same driver and returns a negative, positive, or
zero value <I>a la</I> the <CODE>strcmp</CODE> function.<A NAME="DOCF7" HREF="VFL.html#FOOT7">(7)</A> If this 
function is not provided then HDF5 assumes that all calls to the <CODE>open</CODE>
callback return unique files regardless of the arguments and it is up to the
application to avoid doing this if that assumption is incorrect.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
Each time a file is opened the library calls the <CODE>cmp</CODE> function to
compare that file with all other files currently open by the same driver and
if one of them matches (at most one can match) then the file which was just
opened is closed and the previously opened file is used instead.

</P>
<P>
Opening a file twice with incompatible flags will result in failure. For
instance, opening a file with the truncate flag is a two step process which
first opens the file without truncation so keys can be compared, and if no
matching file is found already open then the file is closed and immediately
reopened with the truncation flag set (if a matching file is already open then
the truncating open will fail).

</P>

key. They were initialized when the file was opened.

Some drivers may also need to store certain information in the file superblock

three functions: one to determine how much space will be necessary to store

decode the information. These functions are optional, but if any one is
defined then the other two must also be defined.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>sb_size</CODE> function returns the number of bytes necessary to encode
information needed later if the file is reopened. The <CODE>sb_encode</CODE>
function encodes information from  the file into buffer <VAR>buf</VAR>
allocated by the caller. It also writes an 8-character (plus null
termination) into the <CODE>name</CODE> argument, which should be a unique
identification for the driver. The <CODE>sb_decode</CODE> function looks at
the <VAR>name</VAR>

 decodes
data from the buffer <VAR>buf</VAR> and updates the <VAR>file</VAR> argument with the new information,

</DL>

</P>
<P>
The part of this which is somewhat tricky is that the file must be readable
before the superblock information is decoded. File access modes fall outside
the scope of the HDF5 file format, but they are placed inside the boot block
for convenience.<A NAME="DOCF8" HREF="VFL.html#FOOT8">(8)</A>

<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="VFL.html#TOC14">Address Space Functions</A></H2>

<P>
HDF5 does not assume that a file is a linear address space of bytes. Instead,
the library will call functions to allocate and free portions of the HDF5
format address space, which in turn map onto functions in the file driver to
allocate and free portions of file address space. The library tells the file
driver how much format address space it wants to allocate and the driver
decides what format address to use and how that format address is mapped onto
the file address space.  Usually the format address is chosen so that the file
address can be calculated in constant time for data I/O operations (which are
always specified by format addresses).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="VFL.html#TOC15">Userblock and Superblock</A></H3>

<P>
The HDF5 format allows an optional userblock to appear before the actual HDF5 
data in such a way that if the userblock is <STRONG>sucked out</STRONG> of the file and
everything remaining is shifted downward in the file address space, then the
file is still a valid HDF5 file.  The userblock size can be zero or any
multiple of two greater than or equal to 512 and the file superblock begins
immediately after the userblock.

</P>
<P>
HDF5 allocates space for the userblock and superblock by calling an
allocation function defined below, which must return a chunk of memory at
format address zero on the first call.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="VFL.html#TOC16">Allocation of Format Regions</A></H3>

<P>
The library makes many types of allocation requests: 

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>H5FD_MEM_SUPER</CODE>
<DD>
An allocation request for the userblock and/or superblock.
<DT><CODE>H5FD_MEM_BTREE</CODE>
<DD>
An allocation request for a node of a B-tree.
<DT><CODE>H5FD_MEM_DRAW</CODE>
<DD>
An allocation request for the raw data of a dataset.
<DT><CODE>H5FD_MEM_META</CODE>
<DD>
An allocation request for the raw data of a dataset which
the user has indicated will be relatively small.
<DT><CODE>H5FD_MEM_GROUP</CODE>
<DD>
An allocation request for a group leaf node (internal nodes of the group tree
are allocated as H5MF_BTREE).
<DT><CODE>H5FD_MEM_GHEAP</CODE>
<DD>
An allocation request for a global heap collection. Global heaps are used to
store certain types of references such as dataset region references.  The set
of all global heap collections can become quite large.
<DT><CODE>H5FD_MEM_LHEAP</CODE>
<DD>
An allocation request for a local heap. Local heaps are used to store the
names which are members of a group. The combined size of all local heaps is a
function of the number of object names in the file.
<DT><CODE>H5FD_MEM_OHDR</CODE>
<DD>
An allocation request for (part of) an object header. Object headers are
relatively small and include meta information about objects (like the data
space and type of a dataset) and attributes.
</DL>

<P>
When a chunk of memory is freed the library adds it to a free list and
allocation requests are satisfied from the free list before requesting memory
from the file driver. Each type of allocation request enumerated above has its
own free list, but the file driver can specify that certain object types can
share a free list. It does so by providing an array which maps a request type
to a free list. If any value of the map is <CODE>H5MF_DEFAULT</CODE> (zero) then the
object's own free list is used. The special value <CODE>H5MF_NOLIST</CODE> indicates
that the library should not attempt to maintain a free list for that
particular object type, instead calling the file driver each time an object of
that type is freed.

</P>
<P>
Mappings predefined in the <TT>`H5FDpublic.h'</TT> file are:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>H5FD_FLMAP_SINGLE</CODE>
<DD>
All memory usage types are mapped to a single free list.
<DT><CODE>H5FD_FLMAP_DICHOTOMY</CODE>
<DD>
Memory usage is segregated into meta data and raw data for the purposes of
memory management.
<DT><CODE>H5FD_FLMAP_DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
Each memory usage type has its own free list.
</DL>

<P>
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG> To make a map that manages object headers on one free list
and everything else on another free list one might initialize the map with the 
following code: (the use of <CODE>H5FD_MEM_SUPER</CODE> is arbitrary)

</P>

<PRE>
H5FD_mem_t mt, map[H5FD_MEM_NTYPES];

    map[mt] = (H5FD_MEM_OHDR==mt) ? mt : H5FD_MEM_SUPER;
}
</PRE>

<P>
If an allocation request cannot be satisfied from the free list then one of
two things happen. If the driver defines an allocation callback then it is
used to allocate space; otherwise new memory is allocated from the end of the
format address space by incrementing the end-of-address marker.

The <VAR>file</VAR> argument is the file from which space is to be allocated,
<VAR>type</VAR> is the type of memory being requested (from the list above) without

bytes being requested.  The library is allowed to allocate large chunks of
storage and manage them in a layer above the file driver (although the current
library doesn't do that).  The allocation function should return a format
address for the first byte allocated.  The allocated region extends from that
address for <VAR>size</VAR> bytes.  If the request cannot be honored then the
undefined address value is returned (<CODE>HADDR_UNDEF</CODE>). The first call to
this function for a file which has never had memory allocated <EM>must</EM>

A driver may choose to not define the <CODE>free</CODE> function, in which case

<DT>H5FD_FEAT_DATA_SIEVE            (0x00000004)
<DD>Defining the H5FD_FEAT_DATA_SIEVE for a VFL driver means that
the library will attempt to cache raw data as it is read from/written to
a file in a "data sieve" buffer.  See Rajeev Thakur's papers:

<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="VFL.html#TOC23">Registration of a Driver</A></H2>

<P>
Before a driver can be used the HDF5 library needs to be told of its
existence.  This is done by registering the driver, which results in a driver
identification number. Instead of passing many arguments to the registration
function, the driver information is entered into a structure and the address
of the structure is passed to the registration function where it is
copied. This allows the HDF5 API to be extended while providing backward
compatibility at the source level.

<P>
The driver described by struct <VAR>cls</VAR> is registered with the library and an 
ID number for the driver is returned.

<P>
The <CODE>H5FD_class_t</CODE> type is a struct with the following fields:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>const char *name</CODE>

An optional function which copies a driver-defined file access mode structure.
This field takes precedence over <CODE>fm_size</CODE> when both are defined.
<DT><CODE>void (*fapl_free)(void *fapl)</CODE>

structure.  This field takes precedence over <CODE>xm_size</CODE> when both are
defined.
<DT><CODE>void (*dxpl_free)(void *dxpl)</CODE>
<DD>
An optional function to free the driver-defined data transfer mode

A driver can be removed from the library by unregistering it

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> herr_t <B>H5Dunregister</B> <I>(hid_t <VAR>driver</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX14"></A>
Where <VAR>driver</VAR> is the ID number returned when the driver was registered.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
Unregistering a driver makes it unusable for creating new file access or data
transfer property lists but doesn't affect any property lists or files that
already use that driver.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="VFL.html#TOC24">Querying Driver Information</A></H2>

This function is intended to be used by driver functions, not applications.
It returns a pointer directly into the file access property list
<CODE><VAR>fapl</VAR></CODE> which is a copy of the driver's file access mode originally
provided to the <CODE>H5Pset_driver</CODE> function. If its argument is a data
transfer property list <CODE>fxpl</CODE> then it returns a pointer to the
driver-specific data transfer information instead.
</DL>

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="VFL.html#TOC25">Miscellaneous</A></H1>

<P>
The various private <CODE>H5F_low_*</CODE> functions will be replaced by public
<CODE>H5FD*</CODE> functions so they can be called from drivers.

</P>
<P>
All private functions <CODE>H5F_addr_*</CODE> which operate on addresses will be
renamed as public functions by removing the first underscore so they can be
called by drivers.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>haddr_t</CODE> address data type will be passed by value throughout the
library. The original intent was that this type would eventually be a union of
file address types for the various drivers and may become quite large, but
that was back when drivers were part of HDF5. It will become an alias for an
unsigned integer type (32 or 64 bits depending on how the library was
configured).

</P>
<P>
The various <CODE>H5F*.c</CODE> driver files will be renamed <CODE>H5FD*.c</CODE> and each
will have a corresponding header file. All driver functions except the
initializer and API will be declared static.

</P>
<P>
This documentation didn't cover optimization functions which would be useful
to drivers like MPI-IO. Some drivers may be able to perform data pipeline
operations more efficiently than HDF5 and need to be given a chance to
override those parts of the pipeline. The pipeline would be designed to call
various H5FD optimization functions at various points which return one of
three values: the operation is not implemented by the driver, the operation is
implemented but failed in a non-recoverable manner, the operation is
implemented and succeeded.

</P>
<P>
Various parts of HDF5 check the only the top-level file driver and do
something special if it is the MPI-IO driver. However, we might want to be
able to put the MPI-IO driver under other drivers such as the raw part of a
split driver or under a debug driver whose sole purpose is to accumulate
statistics as it passes all requests through to the MPI-IO driver. Therefore
we will probably need a function which takes a format address and or object
type and returns the driver which would have been used at the lowest level to
process the request.

<P>File access modes do not describe data, but rather
describe how the HDF5 format address space is mapped to the underlying
file(s). Thus, in general the mapping must be known before the file superblock
can be read. However, the user usually knows enough about the mapping for the
superblock to be readable and once the superblock is read the library can fill
in the missing parts of the mapping.

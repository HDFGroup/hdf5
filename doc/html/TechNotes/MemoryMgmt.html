<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h1>Memory Management in HDF5</h1>

      <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
      <h2>Is a Memory Manager Necessary?</h2>

      <p>Some form of memory management may be necessary in HDF5 when
	the various deletion operators are implemented so that the
	file memory is not permanently orphaned.  However, since an
	HDF5 file was designed with persistent data in mind, the
	importance of a memory manager is questionable.

      <p>On the other hand, when certain meta data containers (file glue)
	grow, they may need to be relocated in order to keep the
	container contiguous.

	<blockquote>
	  <b>Example:</b> An object header consists of up to two
	  chunks of contiguous memory.  The first chunk is a fixed
	  size at a fixed location when the header link count is
	  greater than one.  Thus, inserting additional items into an
	  object header may require the second chunk to expand.  When
	  this occurs, the second chunk may need to move to another
	  location in the file, freeing the file memory which that
	  chunk originally occupied.
  </blockquote>

      <p>The relocation of meta data containers could potentially
	orphan a significant amount of file memory if the application
	has made poor estimates for preallocation sizes.

      <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
      <h2>Levels of Memory Management</h2>

      <p>Memory management by the library can be independent of memory
	management support by the file format.  The file format can
	support no memory management, some memory management, or full
	memory management.  Similarly with the library.

      <h3>Support in the Library</h3>

      <dl>
	<dt><b>No Support: I</b>
	<dd>When memory is deallocated it simply becomes unreferenced
	  (orphaned) in the file.  Memory allocation requests are
	  satisfied by extending the file.
	  
	<dd>A separate off-line utility can be used to detect the
	  unreferenced bytes of a file and "bubble" them up to the end
	  of the file and then truncate the file.

	<dt><b>Some Support: II</b>
	<dd>The library could support partial memory management all
	  the time, or full memory management some of the time.
	  Orphaning free blocks instead of adding them to a free list
	  should not affect the file integrity, nor should fulfilling
	  new requests by extending the file instead of using the free
	  list.

	<dt><b>Full Support: III</b>
	<dd>The library supports space-efficient memory management by
	  always fulfilling allocation requests from the free list when
	  possible, and by coalescing adjacent free blocks into a
	  single larger free block.
      </dl>

      <h3>Support in the File Format</h3>
      
      <dl>
	<dt><b>No Support: A</b>
	<dd>The file format does not support memory management; any
	  unreferenced block in the file is assumed to be free.  If
	  the library supports full memory management then it will
	  have to traverse the entire file to determine which blocks
	  are unreferenced.

	<dt><b>Some Support: B</b>
	<dd>Assuming that unreferenced blocks are free can be
	  dangerous in a situation where the file is not consistent.
	  For instance, if a directory tree becomes detached from the
	  main directory hierarchy, then the detached directory and
	  everything that is referenced only through the detached
	  directory become unreferenced.  File repair utilities will
	  be unable to determine which unreferenced blocks need to be
	  linked back into the file hierarchy.

	<dd>Therefore, it might be useful to keep an unsorted,
	  doubly-linked list of free blocks in the file.  The library
	  can add and remove blocks from the list in constant time,
	  and can generate its own internal free-block data structure
	  in time proportional to the number of free blocks instead of
	  the size of the file.  Additionally, a library can use a
	  subset of the free blocks, an alternative which is not
	  feasible if the file format doesn't support any form of
	  memory management.

	<dt><b>Full Support: C</b>
	<dd>The file format can mirror library data structures for
	  space-efficient memory management.  The free blocks are
	  linked in unsorted, doubly-linked lists with one list per
	  free block size.  The heads of the lists are pointed to by a
	  B-tree whose nodes are sorted by free block size.  At the
	  same time, all free blocks are the leaf nodes of another
	  B-tree sorted by starting and ending address.  When the
	  trees are used in combination we can deallocate and allocate
	  memory in O(log <em>N</em>) time where <em>N</em> is the
	  number of free blocks.
      </dl>

      <h3>Combinations of Library and File Format Support</h3>

      <p>We now evaluate each combination of library support with file
	support:

      <dl>
	<dt><b>I-A</b>
	<dd>If neither the library nor the file support memory
	  management, then each allocation request will come from the
	  end of the file and each deallocation request is a no-op
	  that simply leaves the free block unreferenced.

	      </ul>
	  </ul>

	<dt><b>II-A</b>
	<dd>In order for the library to support memory management, it

	      </ul>
	  </ul>

	<dt><b>I-B</b>
	<dd>If the library doesn't support memory management but the
	  file format supports some level of management, then a file
	  repair utility will have to be run occasionally to reclaim
	  unreferenced blocks.

	  <ul>

	<dt><b>III-B</b>
	<dd>The library provides space-efficient memory management but

      <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
      <h2>The Algorithm for II-B</h2>

      <p>The file contains an unsorted, doubly-linked list of free
	blocks.  The address of the head of the list appears in the
	boot block.  Each free block contains the following fields:

      <center>
      <table border cellpadding=4 width="60%">
	<tr align=center>
	  <th width="25%">byte</th>
	  <th width="25%">byte</th>
	  <th width="25%">byte</th>
	  <th width="25%">byte</th>

	<tr align=center>
	  <th colspan=4>Free Block Signature</th>

	<tr align=center>
	  <th colspan=4>Total Free Block Size</th>

	<tr align=center>
	  <th colspan=4>Address of Left Sibling</th>

	<tr align=center>
	  <th colspan=4>Address of Right Sibling</th>

	<tr align=center>
	  <th colspan=4><br><br>Remainder of Free Block<br><br><br></th>
      </table>
      </center>
      
      <p>The library reads as much of the free list as convenient when
	convenient and pushes those entries onto stacks.  This can
	occur when a file is opened or any time during the life of the
	file. There is one stack for each free block size and the
	stacks are sorted by size in a balanced tree in memory.

      <p>Deallocation involves finding the correct stack or creating
	a new one (an O(log <em>K</em>) operation where <em>K</em> is
	the number of stacks), pushing the free block info onto the
	stack (a constant-time operation), and inserting the free
	block into the file free block list (a constant-time operation
	which doesn't necessarily involve any I/O since the free blocks
	can be cached like other objects).  No attempt is made to
	coalesce adjacent free blocks into larger blocks.

      <p>Allocation involves finding the correct stack (an O(log
	<em>K</em>) operation), removing the top item from the stack
	(a constant-time operation), and removing the block from the
	file free block list (a constant-time operation).  If there is
	no free block of the requested size or larger, then the file
	is extended.

      <p>To provide sharability of the free list between processes,
	the last step of an allocation will check for the free block
	signature and if it doesn't find one will repeat the process.
	Alternatively, a process can temporarily remove free blocks
	from the file and hold them in it's own private pool.

      <p>To summarize...
	<dl>
	<dt>File opening
	<dd>O(<em>N</em>) amortized over the time the file is open,
	  where <em>N</em> is the number of free blocks.  The library
	  can still function without reading any of the file free
	  block list.

	<dt>Deallocation
	<dd>O(log <em>K</em>) where <em>K</em> is the number of unique
	  sizes of free blocks.  File access is constant.

	<dt>Allocation
	<dd>O(log <em>K</em>).  File access is constant.

	<dt>File closing
	<dd>O(1) even if the library temporarily removes free
	  blocks from the file to hold them in a private pool since
	  the pool can still be a linked list on disk.
  </dl>

      <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
      <h2>The Algorithm for III-C</h2>

      <p>The HDF5 file format supports a general B-tree mechanism
	for storing data with keys.  If we use a B-tree to represent
	all parts of the file that are free and the B-tree is indexed
	so that a free file chunk can be found if we know the starting
	or ending address, then we can efficiently determine whether a
	free chunk begins or ends at the specified address.  Call this
	the <em>Address B-Tree</em>.

      <p>If a second B-tree points to a set of stacks where the
	members of a particular stack are all free chunks of the same
	size, and the tree is indexed by chunk size, then we can
	efficiently find the best-fit chunk size for a memory request.
	Call this the <em>Size B-Tree</em>.

      <p>All free blocks of a particular size can be linked together
	with an unsorted, doubly-linked, circular list and the left
	and right sibling addresses can be stored within the free
	chunk, allowing us to remove or insert items from the list in
	constant time.

      <p>Deallocation of a block fo file memory consists of:

	<ol type="I">
	<li>Add the new free block whose address is <em>ADDR</em> to the
	  address B-tree.

	  <ol type="A">
	    <li>If the address B-tree contains an entry for a free
	      block that ends at <em>ADDR</em>-1 then remove that
	      block from the B-tree and from the linked list (if the
	      block was the first on the list then the size B-tree
	      must be updated).  Adjust the size and address of the
	      block being freed to include the block just removed from
	      the free list.  The time required to search for and
	      possibly remove the left block is O(log <em>N</em>)
	      where <em>N</em> is the number of free blocks.

	    <li>If the address B-tree contains an entry for the free
	      block that begins at <em>ADDR</em>+<em>LENGTH</em> then
	      remove that block from the B-tree and from the linked
	      list (if the block was the first on the list then the
	      size B-tree must be updated).  Adjust the size of the
	      block being freed to include the block just removed from
	      the free list.  The time required to search for and
	      possibly remove the right block is O(log <em>N</em>).

	    <li>Add the new (adjusted) block to the address B-tree.
	      The time for this operation is O(log <em>N</em>).
	  </ol>

	<li>Add the new block to the size B-tree and linked list.

	  <ol type="A">
	    <li>If the size B-tree has an entry for this particular
	      size, then add the chunk to the tail of the list. This
	      is an O(log <em>K</em>) operation where <em>K</em> is
	      the number of unique free block sizes.

	    <li>Otherwise make a new entry in the B-tree for chunks of
	      this size.  This is also O(log <em>K</em>).
	  </ol>
  </ol>

      <p>Allocation is similar to deallocation.

      <p>To summarize...

      <dl>
	<dt>File opening
	<dd>O(1)

	<dt>Deallocation
	<dd>O(log <em>N</em>) where <em>N</em> is the total number of
	  free blocks.  File access time is O(log <em>N</em>).

	<dt>Allocation
	<dd>O(log <em>N</em>).  File access time is O(log <em>N</em>).

	<dt>File closing
	<dd>O(1).

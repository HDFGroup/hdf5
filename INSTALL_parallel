	    Installation instructions for Parallel HDF5
	    -------------------------------------------

1. Overview
-----------
This file contains instructions for the installation of parallel
HDF5.  Platforms supported by this release are SGI Origin 2000,
IBM SP2, and the Intel TFLOP.  The steps are kind of unnatural and
will be more automized in the next release.   If you have difficulties
installing the software in your system, please send mail to
	hdfparallel@ncsa.uiuc.edu
In your mail, please enclose the output of "uname -a".  Also attach the
content of "config.log" if you have run the "configure" command.

First, you must obtain and unpack the HDF5 source as
described in the file INSTALL.  You also need to obtain the
information of the include and library paths of MPI and MPIO
software installed in your system since the parallel HDF5 library
uses them for parallel I/O access.


2. Quick Instruction for known systems
--------------------------------------
The following shows particular steps to run the parallel HDF5
configure for a few machines we tested.  If your particular platform
is not shown or somehow the steps do not work for yours, please go
to the next section for more detail explanations.

IBM SP2: follow the instructions in bin/config_para_ibm_sp.sh.

TFLOPS: follow the instuctions in INSTALL_TFLOPS.

SGI Origin 2000:
Cray T3E:
(where MPI-IO is part of system MPI library such as mpt 1.3)

#!/bin/sh

RUNPARALLEL="mpirun -np 2"
export RUNPARALLEL
LIBS="-lmpi"
export LIBS
./configure --enable-parallel --disable-shared --prefix=$PWD/installdir
make
make check
make install


SGI Origin 2000:
Cray T3E:
(where MPI-IO is not part of system MPI library or I want to
use my own version of MPIO)


mpi1_inc=""                                     #mpi-1 include
mpi1_lib=""                                     #mpi-1 library
mpio_inc=-I$HOME/ROMIO/include                  #mpio include
mpio_lib="-L$HOME/ROMIO/lib/IRIX64"             #mpio library

MPI_INC="$mpio_inc $mpi1_inc"
MPI_LIB="$mpio_lib $mpi1_lib"

#for version 1.1
CPPFLAGS=$MPI_INC
export CPPFLAGS
LDFLAGS=$MPI_LIB
export LDFLAGS
RUNPARALLEL="mpirun -np 2"
export RUNPARALLEL
LIBS="-lmpio -lmpi"
export LIBS

./configure --enable-parallel --disable-shared --prefix=$PWD/installdir
make
make check
make install


3. Detail explanation
---------------------
The HDF5 library can be configured to use MPI and MPI-IO for
parallelizm on a distributed multi-processor system. The easy
way to do this is to have a properly installed parallel
compiler (e.g., MPICH's mpicc or IBM's mpcc) and supply that
executable as the value of the CC environment variable:

    $ CC=mpcc ./configure
    $ CC=/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpicc ./configure

If no such wrapper script is available then you must specify
your normal C compiler along with the distribution of
MPI/MPI-IO which is to be used (values other than `mpich' will 
be added at a later date):

    $ ./configure --enable-parallel=mpich

If the MPI/MPI-IO include files and/or libraries cannot be
found by the compiler then their directories must be given as
arguments to CPPFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS:

    $ CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/mpi/include \
      LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/mpi/lib/LINUX/ch_p4 \
      ./configure --enable-parallel=mpich

If a parallel library is being built then configure attempts
to determine how to run a parallel application on one
processor and on many processors.  If the compiler is mpicc
and the user hasn't specified values for RUNSERIAL and
RUNPARALLEL then configure chooses `mpirun' from the same
directory as `mpicc':

    RUNSERIAL:    /usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1
    RUNPARALLEL:  /usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np $${NPROCS:=2}

The `$${NPROCS:=2}' will be substituted with the value of the
NPROCS environment variable at the time `make check' is run
(or the value 2).

 *
 * Purpose:	Create a dataset with a simple data space that has the
 *		maximum possible number of dimensions. This program is used
 *		to create the test file `th5s.h5' which has a data space with
 *		a rank larger than what the library can handle.  To build the
 *		test file first change the definition of H5S_MAX_RANK in
 *		H5Spublic.h, recompile everything, then run this program.
 *		Don't forget to change H5S_MAX_RANK back to its original
 *		value and recompile once the test file is created.

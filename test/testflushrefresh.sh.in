# Test script for the flush/evict single objects feature.
#
# This test file doesn't actually perform any tests, rather, it acts
# as a process manager for the 'flushrefresh' test file, which is where
# the tests are actually housed. The reason this script exists is because
# the verification of this feature needs to occur in separate processes
# from the one in which the file is being manipulated in. (i.e., we have
# a single writer process, and various reader processes spawning off
# and doing the verification that individual objects are being
# correctly flushed).

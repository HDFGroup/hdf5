 *
 * Purpose:     This program is run to generate an HDF5 data file with an
 *              empty "symbol table" group.
 *
 *              This file is used in the v1.7 branch (after the "compact group"
 *              checkin) to test compatability.  Compile and run this
 *              program (with the 1.6.x branch), it will generate a file*
 *              called "group_old.h5".  You need to move it to the test
 *              directory in the HDF5 v1.7 source tree.  The test/stab.c
 *              program will read it.

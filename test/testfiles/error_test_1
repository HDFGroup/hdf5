   This program tests the Error API.  There're supposed to be some error messages
********* Print error stack in HDF5 default way *********
Second Test-DIAG: Error detected in Second Program (1.0) thread (IDs):
  #000: (file name) line (number) in main(): Error stack test failed
    major: Error in test
    minor: Error in error stack
Error Test-DIAG: Error detected in Error Program (1.0) thread (IDs):
  #001: (file name) line (number) in error_stack(): Get number test failed, returned 0
    major: Error in API
    minor: Error in H5Eget_num

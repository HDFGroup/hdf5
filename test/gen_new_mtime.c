 * Purpose:	Create a dataset, which should have the newer mtime information
 *      stored in it.
 *		This program is used to create the test file `tmtimen.h5' which
 *      has the new format for mtime information.
 *		To build the test file, this program MUST be compiled and linked with
 *      the hdf5-1.5+ series of libraries and the generated test file must be
 *      put into the 'test' directory in the 1.5+ branch of the library.

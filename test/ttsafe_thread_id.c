 * round of testing.  All NTHREADS threads synchronize on a barrier after each
 * has fetched its ID.  The barrier guarantees that all threads' lifetimes
 * overlap at least momentarily, so the IDs will be unique, and there
 * will be NTHREADS of them.  Further, since thread IDs are assigned
 * starting with 1 (which the main thread gets), the number of threads with
 * IDs alive never exceeds NTHREADS, and thread IDs are never recycled, the
 * least ID has to be (times * NTHREADS) + 2 and the greatest,
